   How can I get myself to just move on? 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're finding it difficult to move on from your feelings for this person, especially when he showed you something new and special. It's natural to hold onto those feelings, especially when they're the first time you've experienced something like that. However, it's important to remember that holding onto those feelings might not be the best decision for you in the long run.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's okay to feel the way you do. It's okay to feel conflicted and confused, and it's okay to take time to figure things out. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over your feelings.

One thing you could try is to take some time and space for yourself. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, taking a step back and giving ourselves some time and space can help us gain some perspective. Try taking a few days or a week to focus on yourself, your own needs, and your own well-being. Engage in activities that make you happy, and try to do things that bring you joy and fulfillment.

Another thing you could try is to talk to someone you trust. This could be a close friend, a family member, or a mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who is non-judgmental and supportive can help you process your emotions and gain some clarity. Just make sure that you choose someone who is someone you feel comfortable talking to, and who will not judge you or try to tell you what to do.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to do this alone. Reaching out for support from others can be incredibly helpful, whether it's through talking to a friend or family member, or seeking out professional help. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and that there are people and resources available to help you.

Finally, try to be kind to yourself. Remember that it's okay to take time to figure things out, and that it's okay to feel confused or uncertain. Be patient with yourself, and try to practice self-compassion. Remember that you are doing the best you can, and that that is enough.

In conclusion, moving on from feelings for someone can be incredibly difficult, especially when the conditions surrounding your love are considered ""wrong"" by a lot of people. However, it's important to remember that you don't have to do this alone, and that there are people and resources available to help you. Take some time and space for yourself, talk to someone you trust, and remember to be kind to yourself. With time and support, you can move on from these feelings and find happiness and fulfillment in other areas of your life.",45.67867398262024
"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times.

After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response:  It sounds like you are in a difficult and potentially harmful situation.

Secondly, I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns. It is important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful manner, and to listen to your partner's perspective as well. It may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance on how to navigate this conversation.

Finally, it is important to consider your options and to make a plan for your own safety and well-being.

"We had great chemistry, but then he became distant. I had the feeling that I can't be without him. As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him. I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened.","People often care deeply for those whom they love. I don't know how long you have been together. It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you.It may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away. It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you. For example, maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he can.Sometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you. You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy, you have the ability to write a message, and he has the ability to answer when he can.I also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened. I don't know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your life.Some people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry, but this is difficult for others.I would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special.Also think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argument.It may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first (such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelming).Perhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person. Remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: We had great chemistry, but then he became distant. I had the feeling that I can't be without him. As soon as I felt the difference, I was scared to lose him. I started freaking out if he did not answer, thinking that something bad happened. 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to feel scared and worried when someone you care about becomes distant. It's natural to feel a strong connection with someone and feel the need to be close to them. However, it's important to remember that people can have their own lives and priorities, and it's okay if they don't always have time for you.

It's understandable that you started to feel anxious when he became distant, but it's important to try to manage those feelings in a healthy way. Instead of jumping to conclusions or assuming the worst, try to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. It's possible that he's going through something himself and is not able to be as present in the relationship right now.

It's also important to remember that you can't control how someone else feels or acts. You can only control how you respond to the situation. Instead of fixating on the distance and trying to force him to be close, try to focus on your own emotional well-being. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and try to find ways to relax and manage your anxiety.

Remember, relationships are a two-way street. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner and to respect their boundaries and needs. If you're feeling anxious or scared, try to talk to him about it and work together to find a solution. With open communication and mutual respect, you can work through any challenges and strengthen your relationship.",24.517184495925903
"I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me.

As a first reflection, it implies that there is a right and a wrong way to feel, in this case, feel upset. I think I would like to ask you the question in a different way: are you feeling upset? If you are feeling upset or if you are feeling another emotion : insert worried, ambivalent, scared, angry, insecure, confused that is likely reasonable if the relationship has undergone some breaks in trust followed by distance (seperation).

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling upset and betrayed after discovering that your ex-partner lied to you about another woman. Lying and breaking promises are significant red flags in any relationship, and it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and safety.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you don't have to go through this alone. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with emotional support and guidance on how to navigate this difficult situation.

In terms of the situation with your ex-partner, it's important to remember that you deserve honesty and respect in a relationship.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this difficult situation with me. It sounds like you're going through a very challenging time with your partner, and I'm here to listen and offer support. Verbal abuse, regardless of how it's labeled, is never okay or justified. It's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated with disrespect or hurtful language, and it's not your fault if your partner is behaving this way.

It's understandable that you might feel scared, anxious, or even embarrassed when your partner gets angry and lashes out at you. It's important to remember that you don't deserve to be treated this way, and you don't have to tolerate it. You deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and compassion, and it's okay to set boundaries and advocate for yourself.

One thing you might consider is having an open and honest conversation with your partner about how their behavior is affecting you. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a calm and respectful manner, and to listen to your partner's perspective as well. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but it can also be an opportunity for growth and healing.

If you're not comfortable having this conversation with your partner directly, you might consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who can act as a mediator and provide support. A mental health professional can help you process your feelings and develop strategies for setting boundaries and communicating effectively with your partner.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are resources available to help you navigate this difficult situation, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness in a relationship.",27.988527059555054

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you may be feeling conflicted and unsure about what to do, but it's important to be honest and respectful towards your ex-wife. Keep in mind that she has also been through a lot, and it's only fair that you communicate with her in a clear and considerate manner.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge the past mistakes you've made and take responsibility for them. You could start by expressing your regret for your infidelities and the pain they may have caused your wife. Be sincere and empathetic in your apology, and make sure you're not blaming or making excuses for your actions.

Next, you could explain the current situation with your new partner and the baby. Be honest and direct about your feelings, but also be mindful of your ex-wife's feelings. It's important to be respectful and considerate of her emotions, even if you're no longer together.

It may be helpful to have this conversation in person, rather than over the phone or through a messaging app. This will allow you to have a more personal and meaningful conversation, and to be able to read each other's body language and emotions.

When you do have the conversation, try to be as clear and direct as possible. Avoid beating around the bush or being evasive, as this can cause confusion and frustration. Instead, focus on being honest and open, and try to find a resolution that works for both of you.

How does a person start the counseling process?,"Hello. Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. That first session is often very low key. There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. It's true. We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. What makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. Counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. Coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together. Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. We honestly do not, plain and simple. Counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. Yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. Very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. So as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: How does a person start the counseling process? 

 ### Response:  Starting the counseling process can be a daunting task, but it is an important step towards healing and growth. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. Identify the need for counseling: The first step is to recognize when you need counseling. This can be due to various reasons such as a major life change, a mental health issue, or a difficult situation. If you find yourself struggling to cope with your emotions or experiences, counseling can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and work towards healing.

2. Research and find a counselor: Once you have identified the need for counseling, the next step is to find a qualified counselor. You can ask for referrals from your primary care physician, mental health professionals, or trusted friends and family members. You can also search online or check with local mental health organizations. Look for a counselor who is licensed, experienced, and a good fit for your needs.

3. Schedule an initial consultation: Once you have found a counselor, schedule an initial consultation. This is an opportunity to get to know the counselor, discuss your concerns, and determine if they are the right fit for you. Be honest and open about your reasons for seeking counseling, and ask questions about the counselor's approach, experience, and qualifications.

4. Prepare for the first session: Before your first session, take some time to reflect on your experiences and emotions. Think about what you want to achieve through counseling and what you hope to gain. It can also be helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal or bring a list of questions to ask the counselor.

5. Attend the first session: The first session will typically involve an introduction, a review of your reasons for seeking counseling, and a discussion of your goals and expectations. The counselor may also ask questions to get to know you better and understand your needs. Be open and honest about your experiences and feelings, and feel free to ask questions or express concerns as needed.

6. Follow up and maintain progress: After the initial consultation, it is important to follow up with your counselor and maintain regular sessions. This can help you stay on track with your progress and continue to work towards your goals. Be open and honest about your experiences and feelings, and don't hesitate to ask for support or guidance when needed.

In conclusion, starting the counseling process can be a significant step towards healing and growth. By identifying the need for counseling, researching and finding a qualified counselor, preparing for the first session, attending the first session, and following up and maintaining progress, you can work towards achieving your goals and improving your mental health. Remember, counseling is a collaborative process, and it is important to be open and honest about your experiences and feelings in order to achieve the best possible results.",46.60819149017334
I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for just over a year. This past week she admitted to me that she has feelings for another guy. She says it’s “just a crush” but I don't know how to cope with it.    How should I deal with this?,"Those words must have been extremely difficult to hear or read. It sounds like you are both having difficulty with the distance, and I can only imagine that you have both been coping with this distance as well as you can. There are a few scenarios that I think would have pretty radically different paths for your own mental health, and I would like to explore them separately. The first scenario is that she has this crush, but still chooses you and wishes to stay with you. Keeping the value of her choice in mind, and the bravery she has shown in admitting this crush, handling her gently in that vulnerable place will pay off. You may find it worthwhile to explain your feelings about it, to share how it is hurting you to know of this, and what she means to you. Explaining those feelings will help you to not act out in your with emotions to cover up by becoming angry or withdrawing. Acting in this way will help assure her of her choice in you, and sharing these emotions and feeling supported by her may help you cope with this.The other scenario is that she has a crush on this man and she is wanting to leave the relationship with you to have one with this other person. As before, it would be useful for you to share your feelings with someone. It can be difficult to process through these emotions, as they are intense and often overwhelming. In this scenario, it may be too difficult to share these feelings with your girlfriend, but it is still important that you acknowledge this loss and allow the associated emotions to have its place. Grieving the end of this relationship could be a great source of personal growth.I hope this has been of some help.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that this can be a difficult and emotional situation for you. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and unsure of how to cope with the news. However, it's important to remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected, and it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own emotional well-being.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're hurt and confused by her admission, and express your concerns about the future of your relationship. Be specific about what you need from her in order to move forward, such as reassurance that she's committed to the relationship or a plan for how she will handle her feelings for this other guy.

It may also be helpful to take some time for yourself to process your emotions and reflect on what you want for your relationship. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member for support and guidance. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel happy and fulfilled, and don't be afraid to prioritize your own needs and desires.

It's also important to remember that relationships involve ups and downs, and it's okay if things don't always go as planned.

 ### Input: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me? 

 ### Response: 

It is completely normal for people to cry during therapy sessions. In fact, it is a common occurrence. Crying during therapy is a natural response to processing and working through difficult emotions and experiences. It is important to remember that therapy is a safe space for you to express your emotions and work through challenges, and it is okay to feel vulnerable and emotional during these sessions.

Crying during therapy can serve several purposes. Firstly, it can be a way to release pent-up emotions and tensions that have been building up over time. When you cry during therapy, you are allowing yourself to release these emotions in a healthy and constructive way, which can help you feel more relaxed and calm. Secondly, crying during therapy can be a way to communicate and express feelings that may be difficult to put into words. Sometimes, tears can be a more effective way to convey emotions than words alone.

It is important to remember that therapy is not just about talking and processing emotions, but also about the physical and emotional release that can occur during the session. The act of crying can be a powerful and cathartic experience, and it is a normal part of the therapeutic process.

It is also worth noting that crying during therapy is not a sign of weakness or vulnerability. On the contrary, it takes courage and vulnerability to allow yourself to be open and emotional during therapy. It is a sign that you are taking care of yourself and prioritizing your mental health, which is a brave and admirable act.

In summary, it is completely normal for people to cry during therapy sessions. It is a natural response to processing and working through difficult emotions and experiences, and it can serve several purposes. It is important to remember that therapy is a safe space for you to express your emotions and work through challenges, and that crying during therapy is a sign of courage and vulnerability.",30.988178968429565
"I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk.    In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol.    But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?","Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" You might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict. I don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation.  One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support. Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger. I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem? 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It's completely understandable to feel guilty after drinking too much and acting out in ways that you don't want to. It's important to recognize that alcohol can affect your behavior and decision-making, and it's possible that you may have a problem with alcohol that needs to be addressed. However, it's also important to consider the role that other factors may play in your feelings of guilt. 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not alone in experiencing these feelings. Many people struggle with alcohol use and the negative consequences that can come with it, including feelings of guilt and shame. It's important to recognize that you are not inherently flawed or weak, but rather that you may be struggling with a common issue that affects many people. 

It's also possible that your feelings of guilt may be related to other underlying issues, such as stress, anxiety, or trauma. In these cases, it may be helpful to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can work with you to address these underlying issues and develop coping strategies to manage your alcohol use. 

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your feelings of guilt: 

1. Practice self-compassion: It's important to be kind and compassionate towards yourself, rather than beating yourself up over your actions. Remember that you are human and that it's okay to make mistakes. 

2. Set boundaries: It's important to be mindful of your alcohol consumption and to set boundaries for yourself. This may mean limiting the amount you drink, or avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to drink too much. 

3. Seek support: Talk to friends and family members about your struggles with alcohol, and seek their support and encouragement. It can also be helpful to join a support group or seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. 

In summary, it's important to recognize that your feelings of guilt may be related to a combination of factors, including your alcohol use and any underlying issues. By practicing self-compassion, setting boundaries, and seeking support, you can work towards managing your feelings of guilt and developing healthier coping strategies for managing your alcohol use.

 ### Response: 

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you have a tendency to lash out when you're upset or angry, and to seek to change that behavior. It's important to recognize that your actions are not only causing harm to others, but also to yourself and your relationships.

Firstly, it's important to understand that cursing and offending others is not a healthy way to manage your emotions. It may provide a temporary sense of relief, but it can also lead to further conflict and damage to your relationships. Instead of resorting to mean words, try to find healthier ways to express your emotions, such as taking a break to calm down, practicing deep breathing exercises, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.

Secondly, it's important to recognize that starting rumors or saying negative things about you or your relationship is not a productive or respectful way to address any issues that may arise. Gossip and negativity can quickly spread and cause harm to your relationships and reputation. Instead of engaging in gossip or negative talk, try to address any issues directly and constructively with the person involved.

Thirdly, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and their impact on those around you. It's okay to make mistakes and have flaws, but it's important to own up to them and make amends when necessary. Apologize to those you have hurt and make a conscious effort to change your behavior in the future.

Finally, it's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle. Many people struggle with managing their emotions and behaviors in difficult situations. Seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist can be incredibly helpful in learning how to manage your emotions and behaviors in a healthier way.

Remember, changing your behavior takes time and effort, but it is possible with practice and dedication. Be patient with yourself and keep working towards your goal of being a better person and having healthier relationships.",31.761514902114868
"I don’t love my sister. I would never wish her harm, but if I could, I would wish for us not to be related. Is this cruel? Why must blood mean we have to be friends?

In fact, sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each other's flaws and imperfections. With that being said - it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister.

It’s not just a ""teenager phase."" I still love my mom and dad, and I’m very close to them. However, it’s my sister I don’t love or have ever really liked at all. 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable to have complicated feelings towards a sibling, especially if you don't have a particularly close or positive relationship with them. Wishing for not being related to someone may seem like an unconventional or even cruel desire, but it's important to recognize that these feelings are valid and can be a result of various factors.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that blood ties don't necessarily determine the quality of a relationship. Just because you share a biological connection with your sister doesn't mean you have to be close or even like each other. Many people have strained or distant relationships with their siblings, and it's not uncommon for siblings to have different personalities, interests, or values that can create tension.

It's also worth considering the reasons behind your lack of affection towards your sister. Was there a particular incident or experience that led to this feeling? Are there any unresolved issues or conflicts between you two that need to be addressed? Identifying the root cause of your feelings can help you better understand and manage them.

While it may seem challenging to fix a strained relationship with your sister, it's not impossible. Communication and empathy are key in building a stronger connection with your sibling. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Talk to your sister: Have an open and honest conversation with your sister about how you feel. Be sure to listen to her perspective as well and try to find common ground.
2. Identify common interests: Look for activities or hobbies that you both enjoy, and try to spend time together doing those things. This can help create a positive and enjoyable atmosphere.
3. Set boundaries: If there are certain behaviors or actions that trigger negative feelings towards your sister, it's important to communicate those boundaries clearly and respectfully.
4. Seek outside help: If you're finding it difficult to navigate your feelings and improve your relationship with your sister on your own, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with additional support and guidance.

Remember, it's okay to have complicated feelings towards a sibling, and it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being. By acknowledging and addressing these feelings, you can work towards building a more positive and healthy relationship with your sister.",37.15426969528198

 ### Input: I've been getting told lately by my partner that it’s embarrassing that I'm so antisocial around his family and friends. I believe it's because I'm not as social as him. 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this with me. It's understandable that you might feel embarrassed or self-conscious around your partner's family and friends, especially if you're not as social as they are. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own personality and ways of interacting with others, and it's okay if you're not as outgoing or talkative as your partner or his loved ones.

It's possible that your partner's family and friends are just used to him being the life of the party, and they might be taken aback by your more reserved nature. But that doesn't mean you have to change who you are to fit in with them. Instead, try to find ways to be yourself and enjoy their company in a way that feels comfortable and natural for you.

One way to do this is to find common interests or hobbies that you can talk about with their family and friends. This can help you connect with them on a more personal level and find ways to engage with them that feel more natural and enjoyable for you. You could also try practicing active listening and asking thoughtful questions to show your interest in their lives and experiences.

It's also important to communicate with your partner about how you're feeling. Let him know that you're trying your best to be yourself and enjoy his family and friends, but that you might need some extra support or encouragement in doing so. He might be able to offer some advice or help you come up with strategies for feeling more comfortable around them.

Remember, it's okay to be different from the people around you, and it's important to be true to yourself in any social situation. With time and practice, you can find ways to be yourself and enjoy the company of your partner's family and friends in a way that feels comfortable and enjoyable for everyone involved.",29.02007031440735

 ### Response: 

 Sorry to hear that you've been experiencing nightmares and hearing voices. It can be very distressing and disruptive to your daily life. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this experience, and there are many resources available to help you cope with these feelings.

 Have you considered talking to a mental health professional about what you're going through? They can help you identify the underlying causes of your nightmares and voices, and provide you with coping strategies and techniques to manage them.

 In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help you relax and manage your stress levels. For example, you can try practicing deep breathing exercises, engaging in physical activity, or practicing mindfulness meditation.

 Remember that it's okay to reach out for help, and don't be afraid to talk to someone you trust about what you're going through. You don't have to go through this alone.

### Additional thoughts:

It's important to remember that nightmares and voices can be a symptom of a larger mental health issue, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). If you're experiencing these symptoms regularly, it may be worth speaking with a mental health professional to rule out any underlying conditions.

In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms. For example, you can try keeping a dream journal to track your nightmares and identify any recurring themes or triggers. You can also try practicing relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or visualization, to help you relax and manage your stress levels.

Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to support you.",31.595131397247314

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and concerned about your girlfriend's recent behavior. It's important to address the issue directly and openly with her, rather than speculating or jumping to conclusions. Here are some steps you can take to try to understand what's going on and work on rebuilding your relationship:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting where you both feel safe and relaxed, and try to have the conversation without getting defensive or emotional. Ask her directly if there's something going on that's causing her to be distant or spending more time with her friend. Listen carefully to her response and try to understand her perspective.
2. Reflect on your own behavior and attitudes. It's possible that your girlfriend's behavior is a reaction to something you've done or said. Take some time to reflect on your own actions and attitudes, and consider whether there's anything you could have done differently to improve the situation.
3. Consider the possibility of past trauma. It's possible that your girlfriend's friend has been through something traumatic in the past, and this is why she's been distant or withdrawn. Try to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with your girlfriend about this, and offer support and understanding.
4. Set boundaries and expectations. If your girlfriend is spending more time with her friend and ignoring you, it's important to set clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship. Let her know that you value your time together and that you expect to be treated with respect and attention.
5. Seek outside support. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle the situation, consider seeking outside support from a couples therapist or counselor. They can provide a neutral perspective and help you and your girlfriend work through any issues that are causing the distance in your relationship.

Remember, communication and empathy are key to rebuilding any relationship. Be patient, understanding, and willing to listen and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.",33.61331605911255

 ### Response: 

It's understandable to feel afraid or uncertain when faced with something new or unfamiliar, especially if it's something that could potentially have a significant impact on your life. It's natural to feel this way, and it doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything wrong with you.

One reason you might be feeling this way is because of the unknown. When we don't have all the information or details about something, it can be difficult to feel comfortable or confident. This is especially true when it comes to something as important as your future.

Another reason could be fear of change. Change can be unsettling and unfamiliar, and it's natural to feel hesitant or afraid when faced with something new. This is especially true when it comes to something as significant as your future.

It's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with similar feelings when faced with something new or unfamiliar. It's okay to feel this way, and it's important to give yourself time to process and understand your feelings.

One thing you might consider is talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling. This could be a friend, family member, or mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a helpful way to gain perspective and feel more comfortable with the situation.

It's also important to remember that you have the power to make choices and decisions about your future. You don't have to feel obligated to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable or anxious. It's okay to take your time and think carefully about what you want to do.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're feeling concerned and stressed about the changes you've noticed in your partner's behavior. It's important to remember that relationships go through ups and downs, and it's normal for people to go through periods of feeling disconnected or distant. However, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about how you're feeling and to try to find ways to work through any issues that may be contributing to the distance.

It's great that you're willing to do anything to make your relationship better, but it's important to approach the situation in a calm and level-headed manner. Rather than trying to force the issue or pressure your partner into talking about it more, try to have an open and honest conversation about how you're feeling and what you can do to support each other.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. Choose a good time and place to talk: Find a time when you both feel comfortable and relaxed, and try to have the conversation in a place where you can have privacy and won't be interrupted.
2. Use ""I"" statements: When expressing your feelings, try using ""I"" statements rather than ""you"" statements. This can help your partner feel less defensive and more open to hearing what you have to say.
3. Listen actively: Make sure to listen carefully to your partner's response and try to understand their perspective. Ask questions and seek clarification if you don't understand something.
4. Avoid blaming or criticizing: Try not to blame or criticize your partner for their behavior. Instead, focus on expressing your own feelings and concerns in a non-judgmental way.
5. Be patient and understanding: It may take some time for your partner to open up and be willing to talk about their feelings. Be patient and understanding, and try to show your support and love for them.

Remember, communication is key in any relationship. By being open and honest with each other, you can work through any issues and come out stronger on the other side.",33.056689500808716

 ### Input: I didn't trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling. I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on. Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust. 

 ### Response:  It's understandable that you would feel upset and betrayed if you found out that your wife was spending time with someone else, regardless of their sexual orientation. However, it's important to remember that accusing someone without evidence and investigating their personal life without their consent is not a healthy or respectful way to handle the situation.

Firstly, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your wife about your feelings and concerns. Rather than resorting to secretly investigating her friend, try to have a calm and respectful conversation with her about why you feel the way you do. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking her.

For example, you could say something like: ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I've noticed that you've been spending a lot of time with this new guy friend of yours, and I have to admit that it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable. I know it's not fair to assume that something is going on just because he's gay, but I can't help feeling a little jealous or insecure. Can we talk about this and see if there's anything we can do to address my feelings?""

By communicating openly and honestly, you may be able to find a resolution to the issue that works for both of you. It's important to remember that trust is a two-way street, and it's important to respect each other's boundaries and feelings.

Additionally, it's important to consider the reasons why your wife may be spending time with this new friend. Maybe she's just trying to make new friends or expand her social circle. Maybe she's going through a difficult time and needs someone to talk to. Whatever the reason, it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding.

In any case, it's important to avoid making assumptions or accusations without evidence. Instead, focus on communicating openly and honestly with your wife and working together to find a resolution that works for both of you.",33.1941339969635

 ### Response: 

It's completely normal to feel insecure or uneasy in a relationship, especially if you have a history of bad past experiences. However, it's important to address these feelings and work on building trust with your current partner. Here are some suggestions that may help:

1. Communicate openly and honestly: Talk to your partner about how you're feeling and why. Be specific about which actions or behaviors trigger your insecurities. Try to avoid generalizations or assumptions, and instead focus on the specific incidents or situations that are causing you concern.
2. Practice empathy and active listening: Make an effort to understand your partner's perspective and feelings. Listen carefully to what they say, and try to see things from their point of view. Ask questions to clarify their thoughts and feelings, and validate their emotions.
3. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on past relationships, try to focus on the present moment and your current relationship. Pay attention to the ways in which your partner is supportive and caring, and try to build on those positive interactions.
4. Work on building trust: Trust is something that is built over time through consistent behavior and actions. Make an effort to be reliable, honest, and dependable in your interactions with your partner. Follow through on your commitments, and be willing to make amends if you make a mistake.
5. Seek professional help: If you find it difficult to manage your insecurities on your own, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide you with additional tools and strategies to manage your feelings and build trust in your relationship.
6. Take care of yourself: Make sure you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. Exercise, meditation, and self-care activities can help you feel more grounded and secure, which can in turn help you build trust in your relationship.
7. Set boundaries: It's important to set clear boundaries and expectations in any relationship. Communicate your needs and desires to your partner, and work together to find a compromise that works for both of you.
8. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and compassionate to yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over your insecurities. Remember that everyone has flaws and imperfections, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend.

Remember, building trust takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run. With patience, communication, and a willingness to work together, you and your partner can build a strong and secure relationship.",41.97185802459717

 ### Input: I don't know how to tell someone how I feel about them. How can I get better at expressing how I feel? 

 ### Response: 

Feeling uncertain about how to express your feelings to someone can be a challenging experience, but there are several strategies that can help you improve your communication skills. Here are some tips to help you better articulate how you feel:

1. Practice self-reflection: Before you try to express your feelings to someone else, take some time to reflect on your own emotions. Ask yourself what you feel, why you feel that way, and what you want to communicate to the other person. This self-reflection can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings.
2. Use ""I"" statements: When expressing your feelings to someone, try using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. This can help you avoid blaming or accusing the other person and can make your message feel more personal and sincere. For example, instead of saying ""You make me feel happy,"" say ""I feel happy when I'm with you.""
3. Be specific: Try to be as specific as possible when expressing your feelings. Instead of saying ""I feel good,"" try saying ""I feel happy and relaxed when we're together."" This can help the other person understand exactly how you feel and can make your message more impactful.
4. Find the right time and place: Consider the timing and setting of your conversation. Find a time and place where you both feel comfortable and can have a private conversation. Avoid bringing up sensitive topics in public or when you're feeling rushed or stressed.
5. Be honest and vulnerable: Expressing your true feelings can be scary, but it's important to be honest and vulnerable with the person you care about. Try to be as authentic and open as possible, and avoid hiding your true feelings out of fear of rejection or judgment.
6. Use nonverbal communication: Nonverbal communication, such as body language and tone of voice, can be just as important as verbal communication when expressing your feelings. Make eye contact, use open and relaxed body language, and speak in a calm and gentle tone.
7. Be prepared to listen: Expressing your feelings is not just about talking; it's also about listening to the other person's feelings. Make sure you're ready to listen actively and empathetically, and try to understand the other person's perspective.

Remember, improving your communication skills takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and keep working at it. With time and effort, you can become more confident and effective in expressing your feelings to the people you care about.",39.181596517562866

It's completely understandable that you're feeling conflicted and scared about your desire to transition gender. It's important to remember that you have the right to live your life authentically and to make decisions that are best for your own well-being.

Firstly, it's important to understand that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity. It's not uncommon for people to have feelings or desires that don't align with their assigned gender at birth. It's important to recognize that your gender identity is valid and that you have the right to express it in a way that feels authentic to you.

It's also important to understand that transitioning gender is a complex and often difficult process. It can involve hormone therapy, gender confirmation surgeries, and other medical interventions. It's important to research and understand the process, as well as the potential risks and benefits, before making any decisions.

It's also important to consider your support system and the potential impact of your decision on your family and loved ones. It's understandable that you may feel like you can't tell your family about your desire to transition, but it's important to remember that you don't have to go through this process alone. There are many resources available to support you, including mental health professionals, support groups, and advocacy organizations.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to make decisions that are best for your own well-being and happiness. This may involve seeking out professional help and support, as well as being honest and open with the people in your life who are important to you.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and angry when your mother's behavior is causing problems for everyone.

As the disease progresses, people with Alzheimer's may experience changes in their personality and behavior, including becoming more agitated, irritable, or difficult to manage.

It's important to take care of yourself and find healthy ways to cope with your feelings. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn as much as you can about Alzheimer's disease and its effects on the person and their loved ones. Understanding the disease can help you find ways to cope with your feelings and provide support to your mother.
2. Set boundaries: It's important to set clear boundaries and expectations for your mother's behavior. This can help prevent conflicts and reduce your frustration. For example, you may need to establish a routine or structure for your mother's care, or find ways to redirect her attention when she becomes agitated or demanding.
3. Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is essential when caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. Make sure to take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.
4. Seek support: Connect with other caregivers who are going through similar experiences. You can find support groups through your local Alzheimer's association or online. Sharing your experiences and emotions with others who understand what you're going through can be very helpful.
5. Consider professional help: If you're feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope with your emotions, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with emotional support, coping strategies, and help you find ways to manage your feelings.
6. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you stay present and focused in the moment. This can be helpful when dealing with the challenges of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's.
7. Find ways to connect: While your mother's Alzheimer's may be causing difficulties, try to find ways to connect with her and maintain your relationship. This may involve finding activities or hobbies that she enjoys, or simply spending time with her and engaging in conversation.

 ### Input: I no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fiancée. 

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling emotionally drained and disconnected from your emotions after experiencing a series of conflicts with your fiancée. It's important to recognize that suppressing emotions can have negative consequences on your mental health and well-being.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge and validate your emotions, rather than trying to suppress them. Suppressing emotions can lead to emotional numbing, which can make it challenging to experience positive emotions as well. By acknowledging and accepting your emotions, you can begin to process and work through them in a healthy way.

One effective strategy to manage emotions is mindfulness. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you become more aware of your emotions and thoughts without judgment. By focusing on the present moment and your breath, you can learn to separate your emotions from your thoughts and develop a sense of detachment. This can help you respond to conflicts in a more constructive and less reactive way.

Another strategy is to engage in activities that promote emotional expression and release. This can include talking to a trusted friend or therapist, writing in a journal, or engaging in creative activities like painting or music. By expressing your emotions in a healthy and constructive way, you can begin to process and work through them.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and self-compassion. Make sure to get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and practice relaxation techniques like yoga or progressive muscle relaxation. By taking care of your physical and emotional needs, you can improve your overall well-being and better manage conflicts with your fiancée.

Finally, consider seeking professional help if you find it challenging to manage your emotions and conflicts on your own. A therapist or counselor can provide you with additional support and guidance on how to navigate difficult emotions and conflicts in a healthy and constructive way.

Remember, managing emotions and conflicts is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. By prioritizing your emotional well-being and seeking support when needed, you can learn to navigate difficult emotions and conflicts in a healthy and constructive way.",35.64982771873474

"I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.","I admire your courage.If you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity, I would suggest a couple of things. There are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now.

This does not mean that you have to identify as ""transgender,"" but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.As far as telling your dad, if that is particularly concerning for you, I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member (one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time) so that you can talk with some people to have support.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're feeling unsure and scared about how to tell your dad about your identity. It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to support you.

Firstly, it might be helpful to educate yourself on the experiences of transgender individuals and the challenges they face. This can help you better understand your own feelings and the potential challenges you may face in coming out to your dad. You can find a lot of information online, or you could consider reaching out to a local LGBTQ+ organization for support and guidance.

It's also important to remember that your identity is yours to claim and own, and you don't have to feel pressured to label yourself or conform to societal expectations. You are who you are, and that is okay. It's okay to take your time and figure things out at your own pace, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness above all else.

When it comes to telling your dad, it's important to consider your own safety and well-being. If you feel like you could be in danger or unsafe if you come out to your dad, it may be best to seek out support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. They can provide you with a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings and work through this process.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're struggling with some pretty tough emotions, and it's completely understandable to feel like you're not good enough. It's common to feel this way at times, especially when things aren't going the way we want them to in our lives. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, and that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward.

It's great that you're thinking about talking to your parents about how you're feeling. Sometimes, just talking to someone we trust and love can help us feel better and gain a new perspective on things. It can be helpful to find a time when you're both feeling calm and relaxed, and to be honest and open about how you're feeling. You might say something like, ""Hey Mom and Dad, I just wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. I've been feeling really down and like I'm not good enough, and I don't know how to deal with it. Can we talk about it together?""

It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel like you're not good enough sometimes. Everyone goes through times when they feel like they're not measuring up, and it's normal to feel this way. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you, and it doesn't mean that you're not a good person. It's just a feeling that you're having, and it's okay to feel that way sometimes.

If you're not ready to talk to your parents about it, that's okay too. You could try talking to a trusted friend or a counselor instead. They can help you work through your feelings and find ways to cope with them. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help you feel better. One thing you could try is to practice self-care. This means taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. These things can help you feel more energized and better able to cope with your feelings.

You could also try doing things that make you feel good about yourself. This could be something as simple as taking a relaxing bath, or as fun as going out with friends and doing something you enjoy. It's important to find things that make you feel good about yourself, and to make time for them in your life.

Finally, try to be kind to yourself. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes and have difficulties. Be gentle with yourself, and try not to be too hard on yourself when things don't go the way you want them to.

It's completely understandable that you might feel conflicted and scared about your desire to transition genders, especially when it comes to navigating your religious beliefs and the potential reactions of your family. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you find support and guidance.

First and foremost, it's important to take care of your own mental and emotional well-being. This might involve talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings and concerns. They can offer you a safe and non-judgmental space to process your emotions and provide you with emotional support.

It's also important to educate yourself about the transgender community and the resources available to you. There are many organizations and support groups dedicated to helping transgender individuals navigate their journey, including medical and legal support. You can also reach out to online communities and forums where you can connect with other transgender individuals who understand what you're going through.

 ### Input: I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better? 

 ### Response: 

I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. Losing someone to suicide can be incredibly difficult and painful, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling to cope with the loss. However, I strongly advise against using drugs and alcohol as a means of coping with your emotions. While it may seem like a temporary escape or a way to dull the pain, using drugs and alcohol can actually make it harder to deal with your grief in the long run. Here are some healthier ways to cope with your loss:

1. Allow yourself to grieve: It's important to give yourself permission to feel your emotions and grieve the loss of your friend. Acknowledge your feelings and allow yourself to process them in a healthy way.
2. Reach out for support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings and experiences. Sharing your emotions with someone who cares about you can be incredibly helpful and can provide a sense of comfort and support.
3. Take care of yourself: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in regular exercise. Taking care of your physical health can help improve your mental well-being and make it easier to cope with your grief.
4. Find healthy ways to express yourself: Engage in creative activities like writing, drawing, or painting. These activities can provide a healthy outlet for expressing your emotions and can help you process your grief in a positive way.
5. Consider joining a support group: Joining a support group can provide a safe space to connect with others who have experienced a similar loss. Sharing your experiences and listening to others can be incredibly helpful and can provide a sense of community and support.

Remember, coping with the loss of a friend to suicide is a difficult and ongoing process. It's important to be patient with yourself and to allow yourself the time and space to grieve in a healthy way. Don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it, and remember that you're not alone in your grief.",33.174731969833374
"There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong.

 ### Response:  It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of disconnection and belonging, despite having many supportive people in your life. It's important to remember that belonging is a complex and multifaceted concept that can manifest in different ways. While you may have material necessities like food, clothes, and education, it's also important to consider your emotional and social needs.

One way to explore these feelings is to reflect on what constitutes a sense of belonging for you. Is it being around people who accept and appreciate you for who you are? Is it feeling like you're part of a community or group that shares your values and interests? Is it having a sense of purpose or meaning in your life? Identifying what aspects of belonging are most important to you can help you focus on building those connections in your life.

Another strategy is to try new things and seek out new experiences. Joining clubs or organizations based on your interests, volunteering in your community, or taking a class or workshop can help you meet new people and build connections with like-minded individuals. It's possible that you'll find a group of people who share your passions and values, and with whom you feel a deeper sense of connection and belonging.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and self-compassion. Taking time for yourself, engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, and practicing mindfulness and mindfulness can help you feel more grounded and centered.

In summary, feeling a sense of belonging is a complex and multifaceted experience that can involve many different factors. By reflecting on what constitutes belonging for you, trying new things, prioritizing self-care, and seeking support from mental health professionals, you can work towards building a sense of belonging in your life.",33.1005654335022
"After 25 years, I fell in love for the first time. The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye. My heart is burning, and I can't take this pain.","Hi, San Diego. I'm sad that this was your first experience (in 25 years) with feeling in love. You deserve better. My understanding of today's (western?) social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone you've been seeing, without explanation. I don't get it. It's rude. You're better off without this person around. There are still people who operate with respect, but this person isn't one of them.If I'm reading this right, you knew this person for a week? In my humble opinion, much heartache and many poor relationships come from attaching too soon. It takes years to get to know someone deeply. I know it's hard to keep yourself from falling in love, but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly, because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happens.If I was your therapist, I'd be curious about how this is the first time you've fallen in love? Or is it that you were in love 25 years ago?  Was your heart broken then, or did something encourage your heart to close? What has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now? Is there a danger that you will decide love isn't worth the risk?

Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Yes, counseling can help people.How this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding.Also, a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someone's strong emotions overwhelm them.This is different than in everyday circumstances.  When someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone else's feelings, there is no one who asks reflective questions.Last, people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: Does counseling really do anything that can help people? 

 ### Response: 

Counseling can be a highly effective form of therapy for individuals who are struggling with a range of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and relationship problems. Research has consistently shown that counseling can lead to significant improvements in mental health and well-being, as well as in overall quality of life.

One of the key ways that counseling can help people is by providing a safe and supportive space for them to process and work through their emotions and experiences. Through active listening and empathetic understanding, counselors can help individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their mental health challenges, and develop more adaptive coping strategies and behaviors.

Counseling can also help individuals develop more positive and productive thought patterns, which can lead to improved mood and overall mental health. By learning how to reframe negative thoughts and beliefs, individuals can develop a more optimistic outlook on life and themselves, which can have a profound impact on their mental health and well-being.

Another important way that counseling can help people is by teaching them how to manage stress and anxiety in a healthy and productive way. Through relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and other evidence-based interventions, counselors can help individuals learn how to manage their stress and anxiety levels, and develop more resilience and coping skills.

In addition to these individual-level benefits, counseling can also have broader societal-level benefits. For example, counseling can help individuals develop more positive and supportive relationships with others, which can lead to stronger and more resilient social connections and communities.

Overall, the research consistently shows that counseling can be a highly effective form of therapy for individuals who are struggling with a range of mental health issues. By providing a safe and supportive space for individuals to process and work through their emotions and experiences, counseling can lead to significant improvements in mental health and well-being, and can have a profound impact on overall quality of life.",32.1169331073761
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","Hi there, Thank you for your openness about the challenge you are experiencing in your relationship. Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people's life, but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple. The first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband. It's important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example, asking your husband how often does he want to have sex/ week or /month. When having this conversation, it's important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem, yet. There are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic/friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page - lack of sex might not be a problem. If there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire, I would recommend seeing a professional relationship & sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic, what's creating it, what's getting in a way of connecting sexually and to assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that every couple is different and has their own unique sexual needs and desires. It's not uncommon for couples to experience a decrease in sexual intimacy over time, especially if they have children, work-related stress, or other life changes. In your case, it's possible that you and your husband have simply drifted apart in terms of your sexual connection.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about your feelings and desires. Have a calm and respectful conversation with him about how you feel, and ask him to share his thoughts and feelings as well. Be sure to listen actively and try to understand each other's perspectives.

One potential solution is to set aside dedicated time for intimacy and connection. This could be a weekly or monthly date night where you and your husband can focus on each other and your relationship. You could also try new and exciting things together, such as trying a new sexual position or exploring new ways of being intimate.

It's also important to prioritize communication and emotional connection in your relationship. Make an effort to talk to each other regularly and to show affection and appreciation for each other. This can help to strengthen your bond and create a more positive and loving atmosphere in your relationship.

Remember, it's okay to have a low sex drive or to feel disconnected from your husband at times. The important thing is to communicate openly and honestly with each other and to prioritize your relationship and connection. With time, effort, and communication, you can work to rebuild and strengthen your sexual connection and create a more fulfilling and satisfying relationship.",26.3338782787323
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these kinds of feelings, and I'm here to listen and offer support. It's important to know that you are not alone in feeling this way, and that many people struggle with similar emotions.

Firstly, I want to assure you that you are not worthless. Everyone has their own unique strengths, talents, and qualities that make them special and valuable. It's important to recognize and appreciate these qualities in yourself, even if you may not feel like you are living up to your full potential right now.

It's great to hear that you haven't contemplated suicide, as that is a very serious topic. However, it's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling like you want to give up or feel hopeless at times. Many people have gone through similar struggles and have found ways to cope and overcome their feelings of worthlessness.

One thing that can be helpful is to reach out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with a safe and supportive space to talk about your feelings and work through them. They can also offer you coping strategies and techniques to help you manage your emotions and improve your mental well-being.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are some things you can try on your own to help improve your feelings of worthlessness. One thing you can try is to practice self-care and self-compassion. This means treating yourself with kindness, respect, and understanding, just as you would treat a close friend. You can do this by doing things that make you feel good, such as taking a relaxing bath, reading a book, or going for a walk in nature.

Another thing you can try is to challenge your negative thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones. For example, if you find yourself thinking ""I'm worthless,"" you can try to reframe that thought by thinking ""I'm struggling right now, but I'm not worthless. I'm a unique and valuable person who deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.""

Finally, it can be helpful to try to focus on the present moment and what you can control in your life. Rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, try to stay grounded in the present and take things one step at a time. This can help you feel more in control and more able to make positive changes in your life.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are many people and resources available to support you. You are not worthless, and you deserve to feel valued and appreciated. Keep pushing forward, and know that things can and will get better with time and effort.",45.13073945045471

Another thing that might be helpful is to focus on self-care and self-compassion. It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally, during this time. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. It's also important to practice mindfulness and self-compassion, and to try and cultivate a sense of inner peace and stability.

Even though I know this disease is not her fault, I’m still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems 

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable that you're finding it difficult to separate your feelings of disappointment and frustration when dealing with your mother's Alzheimer's disease. Losing intellectual abilities can be incredibly challenging for both the individual and their loved ones, and it's natural to feel a range of emotions as you navigate this situation.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your mother's condition is not a reflection of her love or care for you. Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior, and it can cause significant cognitive decline. While it may be challenging to communicate with your mother in the same way as before, it's essential to remember that she is still the same person you love and care for.

It's also important to recognize that your mother may not be able to process or remember information in the same way as before, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. This can be particularly difficult when it comes to important decisions or conversations, and it may be helpful to find alternative ways to communicate and make decisions together.

One strategy you could try is to use visual aids or memory aids to help your mother remember important information. For example, you could use a whiteboard or a notebook to help her keep track of important dates, appointments, or decisions. You could also try using pictures or symbols to help her remember specific events or conversations.

Another approach is to focus on the things that your mother can still do and enjoy, rather than dwelling on what she can no longer do. This can help to shift your perspective and find new ways to connect and enjoy each other's company. For example, you could try engaging in activities that your mother still enjoys, such as playing games, watching movies, or going for walks.

Finally, it's essential to take care of yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being during this challenging time. Losing a loved one to Alzheimer's disease can be incredibly emotionally draining, and it's important to find healthy ways to cope with your feelings. This could involve talking to a therapist or counselor, engaging in relaxation techniques, or finding support from friends and family.

In summary, it's completely understandable that you're finding it difficult to separate your feelings of disappointment and frustration when dealing with your mother's Alzheimer's disease. However, by acknowledging your mother's condition, finding alternative ways to communicate and make decisions, focusing on what she can still do and enjoy, and taking care of yourself, you can find new ways to connect and support each other during this challenging time.",42.818087577819824

Many people struggle with anxiety and panic attacks, and it's important to remember that you are not weak or flawed for experiencing these feelings.

It's understandable that your family may not fully understand your struggles, and it's important to find support from people who do get it. There are many resources available to help you manage your anxiety and panic attacks, including therapy, support groups, and self-care techniques.

One thing that might be helpful is to try and identify the triggers that cause your panic attacks. Are there any specific situations or stimuli that make you feel anxious? Once you know what your triggers are, you can start working on ways to manage them. This might involve avoiding those triggers, using relaxation techniques, or finding healthy ways to cope with your anxiety.

It's also important to practice self-compassion and to be kind to yourself. It's okay to feel scared or overwhelmed, and it's important to remember that you are doing the best you can. Try not to be too hard on yourself, and instead focus on taking small steps towards feeling better.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your struggles, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that dealing with child custody concerns, financial issues, insecurities, and weight gain can be incredibly challenging. It's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed and emotional at times, especially when you don't have local family support.

Here are some strategies that might help you stay strong and positive during this difficult time:

1. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional health by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath.
2. Seek professional help: Consider consulting a therapist or counselor who can provide you with emotional support and help you develop coping strategies. They can also help you identify any underlying issues that might be contributing to your emotional distress.

5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques can help you stay present and focused, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts and emotions. Try incorporating mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, into your daily routine.
6. Take breaks: It's important to take breaks and give yourself time to rest and recharge. Schedule time for activities that bring you joy and help you unwind, such as reading, watching a movie, or taking a walk.
7. Seek legal advice: If you're dealing with financial issues or child custody concerns, consider seeking legal advice. A lawyer can provide you with guidance and support in navigating these complex issues.
8. Focus on the present: Rather than getting bogged down in the future or dwelling on the past, try to focus on the present moment. Practice gratitude and appreciate the small things in life, such as good health, supportive friends, and the beauty of nature.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and emotional at times. It's important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge your feelings. By practicing self-care, seeking support, and staying positive, you can get through this difficult time and come out stronger on the other side.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Remember that you're not alone, and there are many resources available to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or support.",46.87675380706787
"We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're right that long-distance relationships can be complicated. If he loves you and you love him, that's a great start. I wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved, valued, special, and appreciated.When having important discussions, consider the following:Make sure it is a good time to have a discussion (and if you're doing it in writing because of the distance, you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesn't have 10 minutes or something like that)Try to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other. Asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversations.When having discussions face-to-face, I often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them. As for how that translates to distance, maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the Internet (or, if possible, use some kind of timeframe).Consider what questions you would like answers to. For example, are you wondering:What should I do if I miss you or want to talk to you more? I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I also don't want to hide my feelings. Can I share them with you?If you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly, can I keep sending you messages or is that overwhelming?How will you ask for support from me?Some couples really want to protect each other. In doing so, instead of hiding our emotions, can we share them and work through them together?Whatever else comes to mind.Gary Chapman is famous for his books about the 5 Love Languages.

 ### Input: We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going? 

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about your long distance relationship, especially given the added challenge of your partner joining the military. It can be incredibly difficult to maintain a relationship when one partner is away for extended periods of time, and it's natural to feel afraid that you might lose him to someone else. 

Firstly, it's important to remember that your partner's decision to join the military doesn't mean he doesn't love you anymore. Many people join the military for various reasons, including a sense of duty, adventure, or personal growth, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're leaving you behind. It's possible that he's excited about this new chapter in his life and wants to pursue his goals while still maintaining a strong relationship with you. 

One way to keep your relationship going while your partner is away is to maintain open and frequent communication. Make sure to regularly check in with each other, share updates about your daily lives, and talk about your feelings and concerns. This can help you feel more connected and strengthen your bond despite the distance. 

Another important aspect of maintaining a long distance relationship is to have realistic expectations. It's not always possible to see each other in person, and it's important to accept that there will be times when you're apart. Instead of feeling anxious or upset about these times, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the ways you can stay connected. For example, you could schedule regular video calls or write letters to each other. 

Finally, it's important to prioritize self-care and take time for yourself. Being in a long distance relationship can be emotionally challenging, so it's important to make sure you're taking care of yourself and doing things that make you happy and fulfilled. This could include pursuing hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or engaging in activities that help you relax and recharge. 

In conclusion, maintaining a long distance relationship while your partner is in the military can be challenging, but it's not impossible. By prioritizing communication, realistic expectations, and self-care, you can keep your relationship strong and healthy despite the distance. Remember to be patient, understanding, and supportive of each other, and always prioritize your love and commitment to each other.",36.04194760322571
"I have been married for 11 years. Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other.

 ### Input: I have been married for 11 years. Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart. We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other. I often feel that my husband has ""friends"" at work that he is more emotional invested in than me. I feel very alone and just uncared for. Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected? 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to feel disconnected from your partner after many years of being together. Eleven years is a long time, and it's understandable that you may have grown apart over time. However, it's important to remember that relationships take effort and commitment to maintain, and it's possible to reconnect with your husband and strengthen your bond.

Firstly, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about how you're feeling. It may be uncomfortable, but it's essential to express your feelings and concerns to him. Be specific about how you've been feeling and why you think you've drifted apart. Try to avoid blaming or accusing him, as this can create defensiveness and make it harder to find common ground.

Once you've had this conversation, it's important to work on building a stronger connection with your husband. This can involve spending quality time together, engaging in activities that you both enjoy, and making an effort to listen to each other and show interest in each other's lives. It's also important to prioritize your own needs and desires, and to communicate these to your husband in a respectful and considerate manner.

It may also be helpful to seek outside support, such as couples therapy, to work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to the disconnection. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for you and your husband to explore your feelings and work on building a stronger, more connected relationship.

In addition to these steps, it's important to remember that reconnecting with your husband takes time and effort from both parties. It's not something that can be fixed overnight, but with commitment and hard work, it is possible to strengthen your bond and feel more connected and fulfilled in your relationship.

In conclusion, while it's normal to feel disconnected from your partner after many years of being together, it's important to remember that relationships take effort and commitment to maintain. By having open and honest conversations, prioritizing quality time together, and seeking outside support when needed, you and your husband can work towards reconnecting and building a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.",33.8258798122406

 ### Response: 

Dear friend, I can feel your pain and frustration through your words. It's understandable that you're feeling hopeless and lost, especially when it seems like you're not contributing anything meaningful to society. But please know that you are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

First of all, let's talk about agoraphobia. It's a common anxiety disorder that can make it difficult to leave your home or be in crowded places. It's not your fault, and there are ways to manage it. Have you tried therapy or counseling? These professionals can help you develop coping strategies and provide emotional support.

Regarding your feelings of inadequacy and purposelessness, it's important to remember that you are not defined by your mental health. You are a unique and valuable person with your own strengths and talents. It may take some time and effort to discover them, but they are there.

One way to start identifying your strengths is to think about the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. What are your hobbies? What activities make you feel alive and engaged? These can be clues to your passions and interests, which can help you find purpose and meaning in life.

Another thing to consider is volunteering. Helping others can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and it can also be a great way to meet new people and build connections. There are many organizations that offer volunteer opportunities, so you can find one that aligns with your values and interests.

Lastly, it's important to remember that you don't have to do everything alone. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and encouragement. Talking to others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful and can provide a sense of community and connection.

Remember, it's okay to feel lost and hopeless sometimes. But don't give up hope completely. Keep trying new things, and don't be afraid to ask for help. You are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.

I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal. 

 ### Response:  It's understandable to be concerned about your daughter's well-being, especially if she's experiencing excessive stress and emotional distress. However, it's important to recognize that stress and emotional responses are normal parts of life, especially for children and adolescents who are navigating complex social and academic environments.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that a 4.0 GPA is not necessarily a measure of a child's emotional well-being. While academic achievement is important, it's also crucial to prioritize your daughter's emotional health and well-being. It's possible that her academic success is causing additional pressure and stress, rather than being a source of happiness or fulfillment.

Secondly, it's important to recognize that crying and freaking out are normal responses to stress and emotional distress. Children and adolescents may not have the same coping mechanisms as adults, and they may express their emotions in ways that seem unusual or excessive to adults. It's important to validate your daughter's feelings and offer support and comfort rather than judgment or criticism.

Thirdly, it's important to consider the potential causes of your daughter's stress and emotional distress. Is she experiencing bullying or social pressure at school? Is she struggling with a particular subject or assignment? Is she feeling overwhelmed by the expectations placed upon her by family, peers, or teachers? Identifying the root cause of her stress can help you and your daughter develop strategies to manage it more effectively.

Finally, it's important to prioritize your daughter's emotional health and well-being by providing a supportive and nurturing environment. This can involve setting clear boundaries and expectations, offering emotional validation and support, and encouraging your daughter to engage in activities that bring her joy and fulfillment.

In conclusion, while it's understandable to be concerned about your daughter's stress and emotional distress, it's important to recognize that these responses are normal parts of life. By validating your daughter's feelings, identifying the root causes of her stress, and prioritizing her emotional health and well-being, you can help her manage her stress and emotions more effectively.",35.6046359539032
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation.  For some, this process can take a very long, winding path of self-discovery, while, for others, they are seeking a purposeful, solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. It's important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. I often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals. On a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours.  However, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: Does counseling really do anything that can help people? 

 ### Response: 

Counseling can be a highly effective tool for helping people navigate a wide range of challenges, from managing stress and anxiety to coping with trauma and loss.

They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted.

 ### Input: They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do? 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and tired of being called names, especially when you feel like you're being unfairly targeted. However, before we dive into solutions, let's take a step back and try to understand why this is happening.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that people often act out of their own emotions, beliefs, and experiences. When someone is calling you names, it could be a reflection of their own feelings of insecurity or anger. They might be lashing out at you because they feel threatened or intimidated by your actions or beliefs.

Secondly, it's possible that you're being perceived as hypocritical or babyish because of your actions or behavior. While it's important to stand up for yourself and express your opinions, it's equally important to do so in a respectful and considerate manner. If you're coming across as aggressive, defensive, or immature, it could be contributing to the perception that you're a hypocrite or baby.

So, what can you do to address this situation? Here are a few suggestions:

1. Practice empathy: Try to understand where the other person is coming from and why they might be acting in this way. Putting yourself in their shoes can help you respond in a more compassionate and constructive manner.
2. Communicate calmly and respectfully: When someone is calling you names, try to remain calm and composed. Respond in a respectful and measured tone, and explain your perspective in a non-confrontational way.
3. Set boundaries: If someone is consistently crossing boundaries or behaving in an inappropriate manner, it's important to set clear boundaries and communicate them assertively.
4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about the situation and how it's affecting you. It can be helpful to have someone to confide in and get perspective from.
5. Focus on your own behavior: Instead of getting caught up in the other person's behavior, try to focus on your own actions and how you can improve. Take responsibility for your own behavior and work on making positive changes.

Remember, you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. By practicing empathy, communication, and self-reflection, you can work towards resolving the situation in a constructive and respectful manner.",38.24318718910217

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're experiencing a common phenomenon known as social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder is a mental health condition where individuals experience excessive and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which they are exposed to possible scrutiny by others. This fear can lead to feelings of anxiety, nervousness, and avoidance of social situations.

It's important to recognize that social anxiety disorder is a treatable condition, and there are many resources available to help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Here are some suggestions that may help:

1. Seek professional help: Consider consulting a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who specializes in treating social anxiety disorder. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs.
2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of therapy that can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your social anxiety. A therapist can work with you to identify these patterns and teach you new ways of thinking and behaving that can help you feel more comfortable in social situations.
3. Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy is a type of therapy that involves gradually exposing yourself to the social situations that trigger your anxiety. This can help you become more comfortable and confident in these situations over time.
4. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage social anxiety disorder. However, it's important to note that medication should always be used in conjunction with therapy, as it is not a long-term solution on its own.
5. Self-care: Engaging in self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature, can help reduce overall stress levels and improve your mood.
6. Support groups: Joining a support group, either in-person or online, can provide you with a sense of community and connection with others who are going through similar experiences.

Remember, social anxiety disorder is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. You don't have to face it alone, and there are many resources available to help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.

It's important to take things one step at a time and to be patient with yourself as you work through this process.

"Both of my parents committed suicide together, and I was the one who found them. I suffer from overwhelming depression, which is having an extreme effect on me and my husband’s sex lives. He does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex.","Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding your issue with your therapist. It sounds like you are experiencing some difficulties with your therapist and the clinic, and I'm here to listen and help you find a solution.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it can be very frustrating and disruptive when a therapist or clinic blocks you from seeing other professionals, especially when it's due to a misunderstanding or miscommunication. It's important to address these issues as soon as possible to avoid any further inconvenience or harm to your mental health.

From what you've told me, it seems that you called to cancel your appointment at 4:30 on Friday, but you were late and your therapist didn't receive the call until later. I understand that this can be a stressful situation, especially when you have a double session scheduled for Tuesday.

It's important to communicate with your therapist and the clinic as soon as possible to resolve this issue. I would suggest reaching out to your therapist directly and explaining the situation to her. You could also speak with the clinic's administration or scheduling department to see if they can help resolve the issue.

In the meantime, it might be helpful to consider other options for your mental health care. There may be other therapists or mental health professionals in your area who can provide you with the support and care you need. You could also consider speaking with your primary care physician or a mental health advocate for additional guidance and support.

Remember, your mental health is important, and it's okay to seek help from other professionals if you're not comfortable continuing to work with your current therapist or clinic. Don't hesitate to reach out to me or other resources for support and guidance as you navigate this situation.",28.44076180458069

 ### Input: I have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times. I pretend we aren't married at my work. Recently, he has caught on, but I lie to cover it. He use to talk to girls online, but I have caught myself constantly having a affair. 

 ### Response: 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that cheating in any form is unacceptable and can cause significant harm to relationships. It's important to understand that honesty and communication are key components of a healthy relationship, and avoiding these issues can lead to more significant problems in the future.

It's concerning to hear that you have cheated on your husband multiple times, and it's understandable that he may feel hurt and betrayed by your actions. It's important to consider the impact your behavior has had on your relationship and to take responsibility for your actions.

It's also concerning that you have been dishonest about your marital status at work. It's important to be honest and transparent in all aspects of your life, including your personal relationships. It's important to consider the potential consequences of hiding this information from your husband and the impact it could have on your relationship.

It's important to understand that cheating is not a solution to any problems in a relationship. Instead of turning to cheating as a way to cope with issues, it's important to address these issues directly and work on finding solutions together. This can involve having open and honest conversations about your feelings and concerns, and working on building trust and communication in your relationship.

It's also important to consider seeking professional help, such as couples therapy, to work through any issues that may be contributing to your desire to cheat. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space to explore these issues and work on building a healthier and more fulfilling relationship.

In conclusion, I strongly encourage you to take a honest and open approach to addressing the issues in your relationship. It's important to prioritize communication, honesty, and trust in any relationship, and to seek help if you are struggling to navigate these issues.

 ### Input: My husband doesn’t trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not. 

 ### Response: 

I understand that it can be challenging to rebuild trust in a relationship, especially when there have been past issues that have caused tension. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about how you're feeling and to work together to find ways to move forward.

It's important to remember that trust is something that is built over time through consistent behavior and actions. It's not something that can be fixed overnight, but with effort and commitment from both partners, it is possible to rebuild trust and strengthen your relationship.

One way to start rebuilding trust is to have open and honest conversations about your feelings and concerns. It's important to listen to each other and to try to understand each other's perspectives. It may also be helpful to establish boundaries and expectations for your relationship and to work together to find ways to communicate more effectively.

It's also important to remember that trust is not something that you can force or manipulate. It's something that grows naturally over time as you work on building a strong and healthy relationship.

In addition to communication and boundary-setting, there are other things you can do to help rebuild trust in your relationship. For example, you can work on being more transparent and accountable, and you can make an effort to show your husband that you are committed to the relationship and to working through any issues that may arise.

Ultimately, rebuilding trust in a relationship takes time, effort, and commitment from both partners. It's important to be patient and to remember that trust is something that is built over time, but with work and dedication, it is possible to rebuild and strengthen your relationship.",25.579694271087646

I feel like I'm being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim, when in reality I'm the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends. Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship? 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to feel unsure about how others perceive you in a given situation, especially when it comes to emotions like feelings of being attacked or belittled. However, it's important to consider the possibility that your friends may not be intentionally trying to hurt or dismiss you.

One reason they may seem unreasonable or insensitive is that they may have different communication styles or ways of expressing themselves. For example, they may be more direct or blunt in their communication, which could come across as harsh or insensitive. Or, they may not be aware of the impact their words or actions have on you, and may not realize that their behavior is causing you distress.

It's also possible that there are underlying issues or conflicts in your friendship that are causing tension and misunderstandings. Perhaps there are unresolved issues or unspoken expectations that are contributing to the conflict.

Rather than jumping to conclusions about your friends' motivations or intentions, consider having an open and honest conversation with them about how you're feeling. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example, you could say something like, ""Hey, I've been feeling really upset and hurt by some of the things you've said/done recently. Can we talk about what's going on and find a way to resolve this?""

By having this conversation, you may be able to identify and address any underlying issues, and work towards finding a solution that works for everyone involved. Remember, effective communication and empathy are key to building and maintaining healthy friendships.",24.878762006759644

 ### Input: My daughter is in later elementary school. She can't color in the lines. Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines. 

 ### Response: 

It's completely normal for children in later elementary school to struggle with fine motor skills and handwriting. As they develop their hand-eye coordination and dexterity, it can take time for them to master the art of coloring within the lines. It's important to be patient and encouraging, as this is a skill that can take time to develop.

One strategy you can try is to provide your daughter with plenty of opportunities to practice her handwriting and coloring. This can include providing her with worksheets and activities that are designed to help her improve her fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. You can also try using different colors and writing tools to make the activity more engaging and fun.

Another approach is to try using different techniques to help her color within the lines. For example, you can try using a ruler or a straightedge to help her stay on track, or you can try using a coloring book with large, easy-to-color spaces. This can help her feel more confident and comfortable as she practices her coloring skills.

It's also important to remember that every child develops at their own pace, and some children may need more time and practice than others to master certain skills. So, be patient and don't be afraid to try different approaches to find what works best for your daughter.

In addition to practicing handwriting and coloring, there are other ways to help your daughter improve her fine motor skills and coordination. For example, you can try playing games that involve using her hands and fingers, such as playing with playdough or doing finger painting. These activities can help her develop the muscles and coordination she needs to improve her handwriting and coloring skills.

Overall, it's important to be patient and supportive as your daughter develops her fine motor skills and handwriting abilities. With time and practice, she will improve and become more confident in her abilities.",29.27258586883545

"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years.

Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression.

Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you've been struggling with depression for a long time, and it's understandable that it can be a really tough and overwhelming experience. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and there are many people who have gone through similar experiences.

It's great that you're aware of the fact that your depression re-booted in college, and you're right that the stress of a demanding program can be a significant factor in the development of depression. It's important to recognize that depression is not just a personal problem, but it can also be a result of external factors like academic pressure.

I'm glad to hear that you're no longer self-harming, but it's understandable that you still feel the urge to do so whenever you feel stressed. It's important to remember that self-harm is not a healthy coping mechanism, and it can lead to more problems in the long run.

It's great that you're seeking help and support from loved ones, and it's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. There are many resources available to help you manage your depression, including therapy, support groups, and hotlines.

One thing that might be helpful is to practice mindfulness and self-care techniques whenever you feel stressed or overwhelmed. This can help you manage your emotions and reduce feelings of hopelessness. Some examples of mindfulness techniques include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation.

It's also important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and to make time for activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. This can help you feel more balanced and grounded, and can also help you manage your stress levels.

Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and hopeless at times, and it's important to be kind to yourself as you work through these feelings. It's also important to be patient with yourself and to recognize that healing takes time.

I am on my own with my daughter.

Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area.

 ### Input: How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend? 

 ### Response: 

Deciding whether to end a relationship can be a difficult and emotional process. It's important to take the time to reflect on your feelings and consider the reasons why you may want to end the relationship. Here are some questions you may want to ask yourself:

1. Are you happy in the relationship? Do you feel fulfilled and supported by your boyfriend? Or do you feel unheard, ignored, or unhappy with the way things are going?
2. What are the deal-breakers for you in a relationship? Are there certain behaviors or characteristics that you cannot tolerate, or are there certain things that you need from your partner in order to be happy?
3. How do you feel when you're with your boyfriend? Do you feel comfortable and at ease, or do you feel anxious, stressed, or unhappy?
4. What are your goals and values, and how do they align with your boyfriend's? Are you both on the same page when it comes to things like career, family, and long-term goals?
5. How do you communicate with your boyfriend? Are you able to express your feelings and needs in a clear and respectful way, or do you feel like you're not being heard or understood?
6. What are the signs that your relationship is in trouble? Are there certain behaviors or patterns that you've noticed, or are there certain feelings that you've been experiencing?
7. What are the benefits of staying in the relationship? Are there certain things that you get out of the relationship that you wouldn't want to give up, such as shared memories, emotional support, or financial stability?
8. What are the potential consequences of ending the relationship? Are there certain things that could go wrong if you were to break up, such as financial instability or emotional distress?

By taking the time to reflect on these questions and consider your own feelings and needs, you can make a more informed decision about whether or not to end your relationship. It's important to remember that relationships are complex and multifaceted, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether or not to end one.",33.24073934555054

First of all, did he seem truly remorseful? If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done, it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake. Secondly, was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming, the sting is even more painful. He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.Thirdly, has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this time, he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage, you and the children.Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100% normal. My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your story with me. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and share your personal struggles with someone you don't know. I can understand why you would be struggling with the situation you're in, and it's important to recognize that you deserve to be in a relationship where trust and respect are present.

It's completely understandable that you don't want to break up your family, especially if you have young daughters who may be affected by the decision. However, it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and consider what is best for you in the long run.

One thing you could try is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling. It may be helpful to use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking your partner. For example, you could say something like, ""I feel hurt and betrayed because of what happened, and I'm struggling to trust you again. Can we talk about how we can work through this together?""

It's also important to consider seeking outside support, such as couples therapy or individual counseling. A professional can help you and your partner work through the underlying issues that led to the infidelity and find ways to rebuild trust and improve communication.

Remember, healing and moving forward takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be patient with yourself and your partner, and prioritize your own emotional well-being throughout the process.

 ### Response: 

Moving on from someone you have strong feelings for can be incredibly challenging, especially when the circumstances surrounding your relationship are not socially accepted or understood. It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid and deserving of respect, even if they are not in line with societal norms. Here are some suggestions that may help you navigate this difficult situation:

1. Allow yourself to grieve: It's okay to feel sad and take time to process your emotions. Give yourself permission to grieve the loss of the relationship and the feelings you had for this person.
2. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness, and prioritize your well-being.
3. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings. It can be helpful to have someone to confide in and receive support from.
4. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, try to stay present in the moment. Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay grounded in the present.
5. Set boundaries: It's important to establish boundaries to protect yourself from further emotional distress. Avoid engaging in behaviors that trigger negative emotions or make you feel uncomfortable.
6. Practice forgiveness: Forgiveness is a process, and it may take time. Try to forgive yourself and the other person for any perceived wrongs. Holding onto resentment can make it harder to move on.
7. Create new routines: Try to establish new routines and habits that don't involve the person you have strong feelings for. This can help you distance yourself and move on.
8. Give yourself time: Moving on from a deep emotional connection takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the time you need to heal and move forward.
9. Seek professional help: If you're finding it difficult to move on from this person, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with additional support and guidance on how to navigate this situation.
10. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and try to reframe your feelings in a more positive light. Remember that it's okay to have feelings that are not in line with societal norms, and try to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this challenging situation.

Remember, moving on from someone you have strong feelings for is not easy, but it is possible. Take things one step at a time, be patient with yourself, and seek support when you need it.",43.18162965774536

   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone? 

 ### Response: 

It takes a lot of courage to admit to feeling worthless and to seek help. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling, and that many people struggle with similar emotions. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and like you're not good enough, but it's important to remember that these feelings do not define your worth as a person.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel worthless sometimes, and it's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment. Recognize that these feelings are a signal that something is not right in your life, and that it's okay to seek help to change that.

One way to start changing your feelings of worthlessness is to practice self-compassion. This means treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance, even when you make mistakes or feel like you're not good enough. When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts about yourself, try to reframe them in a more positive light. Instead of focusing on your flaws, try to focus on your strengths and the things that you do well.

Another important step is to identify the sources of your feelings of worthlessness. Are there specific events or experiences that have led to these feelings? Are there people in your life who make you feel this way? Once you identify the sources of your feelings, you can start working on ways to address them.

It can also be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. Talking to someone who cares about you and can offer a fresh perspective can be incredibly helpful in changing your perspective on yourself. They can also offer support and encouragement as you work through these feelings.

Finally, it's important to remember that change takes time. It's okay if you don't feel like you're worthwhile right away – it's a process that takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and remember that you are not alone in this journey.

Remember, you are valuable and deserving of love and respect, regardless of your flaws or mistakes. You are not worthless, and you do not deserve to feel that way. With time, effort, and support, you can work through these feelings and develop a more positive and compassionate relationship with yourself.",35.746615409851074

 ### Input: I can't understand what I pay attention to. 

 ### Response: 

I understand. It can be challenging to focus and pay attention to things when there are so many distractions around us. Have you tried any strategies to help you stay focused? Some common strategies include setting aside dedicated time for work or study, using a timer to help you stay on track, or finding a quiet space to work or study. Additionally, some people find it helpful to break tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, or to use visual aids like diagrams or flowcharts to help them stay organized.

It's also important to take breaks and give your brain a chance to rest. This can help you come back to a task feeling refreshed and more focused.

 ### Response: 

It's completely normal to feel the way you do, especially at your age. The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging, and it's common to experience feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. It's important to remember that these feelings are temporary and can be managed with the right support.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people in their late teens and early twenties experience similar emotions, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you are depressed. It's normal to go through periods of self-doubt and questioning, especially during times of change and uncertainty.

It's great that you are taking steps to attend college and pursue your education. This is a significant accomplishment, and it's important to recognize and celebrate your achievements. However, it's also important to prioritize your mental health and well-being during this time.

If you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with your emotions, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need to manage your feelings and develop coping strategies. It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to help you.

In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your emotions:

1. Practice self-care: Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Stay connected with friends and family: While it's okay to take time for yourself, it's important to maintain your relationships with loved ones. Reach out to them when you need support or just want to talk.
3. Engage in activities that make you feel good: Whether it's reading, writing, drawing, or playing music, make time for activities that bring you happiness and fulfillment.
4. Challenge negative thoughts: When you notice negative thoughts creeping in, try to challenge them with more positive and realistic thoughts.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure of yourself at times. It's normal to question your worth and abilities, but with time and support, you can work through these feelings and develop a more positive and confident outlook.",36.83232045173645

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you might feel upset or conflicted about spending time with your ex, especially if it's been a while since the two of you were together. However, it's important to consider the feelings of your current boyfriend and to be honest with him about what happened.

It's possible that your ex still has feelings for you, and spending time with him can bring up old emotions and memories that may be difficult to navigate. It's important to be mindful of your own emotions and to prioritize your current relationship.

It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Let him know that you value your friendship with your ex, but that you also care deeply about your relationship with him. Together, you can work through this situation and find a way to move forward in a way that feels comfortable and respectful to everyone involved.

Remember, communication and honesty are key in any relationship. By being open and honest with each other, you can build trust and strengthen your bond, even in difficult situations.",16.698994159698486
I hate everything I see in the mirror. I don't like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. It's stressing me out. I don't trust my parents enough to tell them and I don't know what to do.,"This is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a make-over. Play with your features and wardrobe. There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 😕 Sorry to hear that you're feeling so unhappy with your appearance. It's completely normal to have feelings of insecurity and self-doubt, especially when it comes to our appearance.

"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I’m not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.
 I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I don’t know why he is acting this way lately.

It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And you're right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partner's interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you're feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management. There's so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful, and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety.

 ### Response: 

Firstly, it's completely understandable that you're feeling the way you do. The sudden change in your partner's schedule and lack of communication can be incredibly challenging, especially if you're not used to it. It's important to remember that it's normal for people to go through ups and downs in their relationships, and this is just one of those times.

It's great that you're recognizing your feelings and wanting to find ways to cope with them. Separation anxiety is a common issue, and there are many things you can do to manage it. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Communicate with your partner: It's important to talk to your partner about how you're feeling. Let them know that you're feeling lost and sad without them, and express your concerns. They may not realize how their absence is affecting you, and talking about it can help them understand and support you better.
2. Stay busy: Keeping yourself occupied can help take your mind off of your partner's absence. Try taking up a new hobby, spending time with friends and family, or volunteering in your community.
3. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. Engage in activities that make you feel good and help you relax, such as yoga, meditation, or reading.
4. Set boundaries: It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed or neglected, let your partner know. They may be able to help you find a solution, such as scheduling regular check-ins or finding ways to stay connected when they're away.
5. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support. Talking to someone who understands can help you feel less alone and more supported in dealing with your feelings.

Remember, it's okay to feel upset and lost when your partner is away. It's important to prioritize your own needs and find ways to cope with these feelings. With time and support, you can get through this challenging period and come out stronger on the other side.",34.17654991149902

It's bothering both of us.","This can be really anxiety-producing when you have not felt it before. It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.I would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn't much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you. Perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that. You could even remind yourself ""okay, I'm here with [name of girlfriend] and this is okay when I'm with her.""We all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people.

You can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in, the mood you are both in, the subject, etc. There are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment.Another thing that could help is to communicate about communication. If one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable, you could discuss that. If she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable, you could discuss that as well.Hopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

How does a person start the counseling process?,"Great question. The decision to pursue therapy can be a very difficult one and the fact that there seem to be so many profiles that you have to wade through can be particularly daunting. Here's what I suggest to make the process a bit easier: 1) Narrow down your preferred geographical area. Are you in a rural, suburban, or urban environment? If it's either of the latter two, you'll probably have a mental health professional close by. Decide now if it's important to you that their office be within walking or short driving distance. 2) Decide if you need it to be covered by your insurance. You'll have more options if you're willing to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed by your insurance, but more and more people are accepting insurance these days. 3) Find someone whose profile has the key words that you're looking for. If you're struggling with traumatic flashbacks, make sure they have ""trauma"" or something along those lines in their profile.4) Make sure they have a friendly and professional picture. This is small, but this detail shows that they really care about how they present to the world. 5) Come up with a list of about 3 people and rank them from most appealing to least. Set up an appointment with the person who seems like the best fit and give it a try for the first session.

In the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened, from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute. How do I know if he had sex? 

 ### Response: 

It is not uncommon for individuals to feel anxious or uncertain about their partner's behavior, especially in situations where infidelity or unsafe sexual practices may be involved. However, it is important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, rather than resorting to accusations or assumptions.

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that your spouse has disclosed to you that they visited the red light district, which can be a sensitive and potentially vulnerable topic for many people. It is important to respect their privacy and boundaries, and to avoid prying or pressuring them for more information than they are comfortable sharing.

If your spouse has disclosed that they had sex while in Amsterdam, it is important to prioritize their well-being and safety, as well as your own. This may involve having an open and honest conversation about your feelings and concerns, and seeking support from a mental health professional or counselor.

It is also important to recognize that sexual encounters can be complex and multifaceted, and that it is not always possible to know for certain whether an individual has engaged in sexual activity. It is possible that your spouse may have had a blackout or memory lapse, or that they may have been touched or engaged in other forms of sexual contact that do not necessarily involve penetration.

In any case, it is important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, and to prioritize the well-being and safety of all parties involved. This may involve seeking support from a mental health professional or counselor, or engaging in open and honest communication with your spouse about your feelings and concerns.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to prioritize your own well-being and safety, and to seek support and guidance from trusted sources. This may involve seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, or reaching out to trusted friends and family members for emotional support.",29.197845220565796

It's completely understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable and troubled by the memories of your past experiences with your friend.

The problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.There's an analogy that I sometimes use; I don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot; by the time it realises it's dying, it has lost its strength. It's called ""learned helplessness"". When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you. You have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. In my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse. This is a complex picture, and if you were my client, I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you're seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child. I sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist. I wish you the best.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My husband and I have been together for seven years now. I will be honest: I have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. I recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because I was afraid to tell him what happened. Ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. He gets so mad and ignores me for days. He's really verbally and emotionally abusive. He tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. Should we call it quits? I'm tired of crying, but we have a toddler together. 

 ### Response: 

First of all, I want to acknowledge that lying to your partner is never the right solution, and it's understandable that your husband is upset with you. However, I strongly advise against staying in a toxic relationship, especially when there are children involved.

It's important to recognize that verbal and emotional abuse is not acceptable in any form, and it can have serious consequences for your mental and emotional well-being. Being in a relationship where you feel belittled, humiliated, and disrespected can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.

While it's understandable that you may feel attached to your child, it's crucial to prioritize your own emotional and mental health. Being in a toxic relationship can negatively impact your ability to be a good parent, and it's important to create a safe and nurturing environment for your child.

Instead of staying in a toxic relationship, consider the following options:

1. Couples therapy: Marriage counseling can help you and your husband work through your issues and improve your communication. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for both of you to express your feelings and concerns.
2. Individual therapy: If you're not comfortable with couples therapy, consider individual therapy to work on your own emotional and mental well-being. A therapist can help you develop coping strategies and provide emotional support.
3. Separation: If you feel that the relationship is beyond repair, it may be best to separate from your husband. This can give you both time and space to reflect on your feelings and work on personal growth.
4. Support system: Surround yourself with a supportive network of friends and family. They can provide emotional support, help with childcare, and offer a fresh perspective on your situation.

Remember, you deserve to be in a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Don't hesitate to seek help and support to create a better future for yourself and your child.",31.73015260696411
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","It's completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them.  When you cross over from friends to a relationship, it does change things.  Some people are very easy going and wouldn't feel threatened by what you did  Others would be upset.  If your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend, then you need to talk about it.  Each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect.  Then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship.  Maybe he wouldn't be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend.  Or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him.  Most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward.  You didn't do anything ""wrong"" because it doesn't sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend.  But if you really care about your boyfriend, then you probably care about making him upset.  Instead of looking at this issue as a problem, try to look at it as an opportunity to connect.  If you can both listen to each other and understand each other, your relationship can become even closer.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you might feel upset or conflicted about spending time with an ex, especially if it was a significant relationship in the past. However, it's important to prioritize honesty and communication with your current partner about your feelings and actions.

It's possible that your boyfriend may have felt threatened or insecure about your time with your friend, and it's important to address these feelings and concerns in a constructive way. You can start by having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and boundaries, and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

It's also important to consider the reasons why you spent time with your friend in the first place. Was it simply a casual hangout, or did you have unresolved feelings or emotions that you wanted to explore? It's important to be honest with yourself and your partner about your motivations and intentions, and to prioritize communication and trust in your relationship.

Ultimately, it's important to prioritize honesty, communication, and trust in your relationship, and to work together to find a solution that works for both of you. It may take time and effort to rebuild trust and move forward, but with commitment and communication, it's possible to overcome any challenges and strengthen your relationship.",20.0366108417511

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you are in a difficult and frustrating situation. It's understandable that you want a more present and available partner, and it's important to communicate your needs and feelings to your current partner. However, it's also important to consider the root of the issue and why you feel the need to reconcile every time you experience anxiety and depression.

It's possible that your current partner is not making the relationship a priority because he is not invested in it emotionally or intellectually. It's also possible that he is not willing or able to meet your needs in a way that is satisfying for you. In either case, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and needs.

It may be helpful to approach this conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than accusation or blame. You could ask your partner how he feels about the relationship and what he needs in order to feel satisfied and invested. You could also express your own needs and feelings, and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

It's also important to consider whether this relationship is the right one for you in the long term. While it's understandable that you may feel anxious and depressed at the thought of being without your partner, it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to find a relationship that is healthy and fulfilling for you.

In addition to having an open and honest conversation with your partner, it may be helpful to seek out therapy or counseling to work through these issues. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore your feelings and needs, and can also offer guidance on how to navigate this situation in a healthy and constructive way.

Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to find a relationship that is fulfilling and healthy for you. It may take time and effort to find the right relationship, but it's worth it in the long run to find a partnership that is satisfying and fulfilling for both partners.",32.32402324676514

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and confused after discovering your boyfriend's lies. Trust is a crucial component of any relationship, and it's clear that he's broken that trust multiple times. It's important to remember that his actions don't necessarily define the entire relationship.

It's great that he's expressing his love for you and wanting to change, but actions speak louder than words. It's important to see consistent effort and progress towards being honest and trustworthy.

One way to address this issue is to have an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns. It may be helpful to set boundaries and expectations for how you want him to communicate and behave in the future. It's also important to listen to his perspective and understand why he's been lying.

It's also important to take care of yourself during this time. It's okay to take time for yourself, prioritize self-care, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. Remember that you deserve to be in a healthy and trustworthy relationship, and it's okay to walk away if things don't improve.

Remember that rebuilding trust takes time, effort, and consistency. It's important to be patient and understanding, but also to prioritize your own emotional well-being.",21.12667942047119

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're going through a difficult time right now. It's understandable that you feel lost, sad, and unwanted when your partner is away a lot. It can be challenging to adjust to a new routine and feel like you're not getting the attention and support you need.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that it's normal for people to change and adapt to new situations. Your partner's new job and travel schedule may be causing them to be away from home more often, but that doesn't mean they've forgotten about you or don't care about you anymore. It's possible that they're just busy with their new responsibilities and haven't had the time or opportunity to communicate with you as much as they would like.

One thing you can do to cope with this situation is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling. It's important to express your feelings and concerns to them, and to listen to their perspective as well. By talking about your feelings and concerns together, you may be able to find a solution that works for both of you.

Another thing you can try is to focus on taking care of yourself during your partner's absences. This can involve things like taking time for yourself, doing things that make you happy and relaxed, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and to find ways to take care of yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or upset.

It may also be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. Talking to someone who can provide a fresh perspective and offer emotional support can be really helpful when you're going through a tough time.

Lastly, it's important to remember that separation anxiety is a common experience, and it doesn't mean that you don't love your partner or that your relationship is doomed. It's normal to feel anxious or uncertain when someone you care about is away from home, and with time and support, you can work through these feelings and find ways to cope with them.

In conclusion, it's okay to feel upset or overwhelmed when your partner is away a lot, but it's important to communicate your feelings and concerns with them and to focus on taking care of yourself during this time. With time, support, and communication, you can work through this challenge and find ways to cope with it that work for both of you.",37.873438596725464
"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away.

There are many ways to show affection that aren't physical (words of affirmation, giving of time and/or gifts, etc).

 ### Input: My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive.     I love him so much. Why do I do this? 

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and confused when you find yourself pushing away someone you love and care about, especially when it's due to a physical or emotional issue like a decrease in sex drive. It's important to recognize that this behavior is not a reflection of your boyfriend's actions or worthiness, but rather a sign of an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that the decrease in sex drive can be caused by various factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and medication side effects. In your case, being on birth control can certainly affect your libido, and it's possible that this is the root cause of your issue. However, it's also possible that there are other emotional or psychological factors at play, such as past trauma or unresolved emotional issues. 

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Let him know that you love and care for him, but that you're struggling with this issue and need his support. Together, you can work on finding ways to address this issue and find a solution that works for both of you. This may involve seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to work through any underlying emotional or psychological issues. 

It's also important to remember that intimacy and affection are not the only ways to show love and connection. There are many other ways to connect with your partner, such as through shared activities, conversation, and mutual support. By focusing on building a strong emotional connection and prioritizing communication, you may find that your desire for physical intimacy returns over time. 

In summary, it's important to address the underlying issue that's causing you to push away your boyfriend's advances, whether it's hormonal changes, stress, or something else. By being open and honest with your partner, seeking professional help, and prioritizing communication and emotional connection, you may find that you're able to work through this issue and find a solution that works for both of you.",31.802650213241577

Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal. 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to have questions and concerns about life after death, especially if you were raised in a religion that emphasizes the idea of an eternal afterlife. It's natural to feel overwhelmed or uneasy when contemplating the idea of living forever, especially if you're not sure what that would entail or how you would want to spend eternity.

It's important to remember that there is no one ""right"" way to think about life after death, and it's okay if you don't have all the answers. Many people struggle with these kinds of questions, and it's okay to feel confused or scared. It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings and concerns. They can offer support and help you find ways to cope with these thoughts.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to have all the answers right now. You can take things one step at a time and focus on living in the present moment. You don't have to worry about what might happen after you die – just focus on enjoying your life and being kind to yourself and others.

It might also be helpful to explore different spiritual or philosophical perspectives on life after death. There are many different beliefs and theories about what happens after we die, and you might find one that resonates with you. For example, some people believe in reincarnation, while others believe in a spiritual realm where they can connect with loved ones who have passed away. There are also many people who believe in a more general sense of an afterlife, but don't necessarily believe in a specific place or fate.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to find what brings you comfort and peace. Whether you believe in an afterlife or not, it's okay to have questions and concerns. Just be kind to yourself and try to focus on living in the present moment.",28.73893904685974

But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem? 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we have a problem, and it's important to address any issues that may be affecting our well-being and relationships.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that alcohol can have a significant impact on our behavior and decision-making, especially during the stages of intoxication. It's possible that when you're under the influence of alcohol, you may do or say things that you wouldn't normally do or say when you're sober. This can include behaviors like cheating on your boyfriend, which can have serious consequences for your relationship and your own personal growth.

However, it's also important to recognize that feeling guilty after a night of drinking doesn't necessarily mean that you have a problem. Guilt can be a normal response to behaviors that we regret or feel have negative consequences. In your case, it's possible that you're feeling guilty because you're aware of the hurt you caused your boyfriend, and you're taking responsibility for your actions.

That being said, if you find yourself consistently feeling guilty after drinking, or if you're experiencing other negative consequences as a result of your drinking, such as difficulty controlling your alcohol consumption or experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking, then it may be worth exploring whether you have an alcohol use disorder.

An alcohol use disorder can be characterized by a pattern of continued drinking despite negative consequences, and can also involve feelings of guilt, shame, or remorse. If you're concerned about your drinking habits or feel like you may have a problem, it's important to seek professional help from a mental health professional. They can help you assess your drinking habits and provide guidance on how to manage your alcohol use in a healthy and responsible way.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help you manage your feelings of guilt and take control of your drinking habits:

1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Set boundaries: Establish boundaries around your drinking habits, such as limiting the amount you drink or avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to drink too much.
3. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your concerns, or consider joining a support group for people struggling with alcohol use disorder.
4. Consider therapy: A mental health professional can help you explore the underlying causes of your guilt and develop strategies for managing your drinking habits.

Remember, it's important to take your concerns seriously and seek help if you feel like you may have a problem with alcohol. With the right support and resources, you can take control of your drinking habits and improve your overall well-being.",44.856115102767944

Please help! 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for reaching out for support and guidance. It's understandable that you're concerned about your son's violent thoughts and dreams, and it's important to take them seriously. It's possible that your son may be experiencing a common phenomenon known as ""nightmares,"" which can be triggered by various factors such as stress, anxiety, or certain medications. However, it's also possible that your son may be experiencing a more complex issue, such as a mental health condition like depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

It's important to approach this situation with empathy and an open mind. Here are some steps you can take to support your son:

1. Encourage your son to seek professional help: It's important to consult with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can evaluate your son's symptoms and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. A mental health professional can help your son develop coping strategies and techniques to manage his thoughts and feelings, and can also provide support and guidance to you and your family.
2. Listen and validate your son's feelings: It's important to create a safe and non-judgmental space for your son to express his feelings and concerns. Listen attentively to what he says, and validate his feelings by acknowledging that his thoughts and dreams are distressing and understandable. Avoid minimizing or dismissing his experiences, as this can exacerbate his feelings of isolation and distress.
3. Offer emotional support: Provide emotional support and reassurance to your son, and let him know that you're there to support him through this challenging time. Offer words of encouragement and hope, and remind him that he's not alone in this experience. Encourage him to express his feelings and concerns with you and other trusted family members or friends.
4. Help your son develop relaxation techniques: Teach your son relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery, which can help him manage his anxiety and stress levels. These techniques can help him feel more relaxed and calm, and can also help him fall asleep more easily.
5. Encourage healthy sleep habits: Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to help your son fall asleep more easily. Encourage him to avoid caffeine, nicotine, and electronic screens before bedtime, as these can interfere with sleep quality.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable to feel guilty and ashamed after making a mistake, especially one that could have potentially caused inconvenience or harm to another person. However, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we learn and grow from them that matters.

Firstly, it's great to hear that you're trying to make amends by doing random acts of kindness. This not only helps to offset the negative action, but it also shows that you're taking steps to make things right. Keep up the good work, and try to find ways to help others in need.

In terms of atoning for your mistake specifically, there are a few things you could try:

1. Leave a new, legible note: If you haven't already, try leaving a new note in the same location with a clear and legible phone number. This way, if the other driver returns, they'll be able to contact you and you can make things right.
2. Offer to compensate: If you have the means, consider offering to compensate the other driver for any inconvenience or loss they may have experienced. This could be in the form of money, a gift card, or even just a kind gesture like buying them a cup of coffee.
3. Apologize publicly: If you're comfortable doing so, try apologizing publicly to the other driver. This could be through a social media post, a note on a local community board, or even just a simple apology to the person in person.
4. Learn from your mistake: Take this opportunity to reflect on your actions and learn from your mistake. Think about what you could have done differently, and try to be more mindful and considerate in the future.

Remember, making mistakes is a natural part of life, and it's how we handle them that really matters. By taking responsibility for your actions and making amends, you're showing that you're willing to learn and grow from your mistakes. Keep up the good work!",30.106130838394165

 ### Response: 

 Sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable to feel sad and hopeless after a break up, especially when it feels like everyone around you is moving on without you. It's important to remember that this feeling is temporary, and it will get better with time. 

It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're not good enough or attractive after a break up, especially when they're feeling insecure about their body. But please know that you are so much more than your physical appearance. You are a kind, caring, and loving person, and you deserve to be treated with respect and care. 

It's also important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. Reaching out to friends, family, or a therapist can help you work through these feelings and find support. And don't be too hard on yourself about the stretch marks on your stomach - they are a natural part of pregnancy and childbirth, and they don't define your worth as a person.

- Offer to listen to them and provide emotional support.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and I can understand why you feel frustrated and upset. It's important to remember that you have the right to make decisions about your own life and future, and it's okay to stand up for what you want and believe in.

Firstly, it's great to hear that you're passionate about basketball and enjoy playing on your school team. It's important to find activities and hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment, and it sounds like basketball does that for you.

However, it's also understandable that you don't want to continue playing for a team that you hate. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, and if playing for that team makes you feel miserable, then it's okay to reconsider your options.

It's understandable that your parents may have different opinions and expectations, but it's important to communicate your feelings and concerns with them. They may not realize how much you dislike playing for that team, or they may have reasons for wanting you to continue playing that you're not aware of.

One option could be to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and concerns. Explain to them how you feel about playing for the team, and why you don't want to continue. Be respectful and clear about your thoughts, and try to find a compromise that works for everyone.

Another option could be to explore other basketball opportunities outside of school. Perhaps you could join a local club team or find a different school team that you would enjoy playing for. This way, you can still pursue your passion for basketball without feeling forced to play for a team that you don't enjoy.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that you have the right to make decisions about your own life and future. Don't be afraid to stand up for what you want and believe in, and try to find a solution that works for everyone involved.

Remember, it's okay to take a stand and advocate for yourself. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled in your activities and hobbies, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being. Good luck in finding a solution that works for you!",34.490448236465454

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now, and it's completely understandable that you feel like you can't trust your parents. It can be really difficult to navigate family dynamics, especially when it feels like no one is taking your feelings seriously.

First of all, it's important to recognize that it's okay to feel this way. It's normal for teenagers to feel disconnected from their parents at times, and it doesn't mean that you don't love them or that they don't love you. It's just a part of growing up and figuring out who you are and where you fit in the world.

It's also important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. There are people in your life who care about you and want to help, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Your friends may not always be able to be there for you, but they can still be a source of support and comfort. And there are also resources available to you, like counselors and therapists, who can provide a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings.

One thing that might be helpful is to try to find ways to communicate with your parents in a way that feels more effective for you. This might involve finding a time and place where you feel more comfortable talking to them, or it might involve finding a mediator or someone else who can help facilitate the conversation. It's important to be clear and direct about how you're feeling and what you need from them, and to try to find a way to communicate that feels safe and respectful for everyone involved.

It's also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being. This might involve finding ways to manage your stress and anxiety, like exercise, meditation, or creative activities. It might also involve setting boundaries with your parents and taking time for yourself when you need it. Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and care, and that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and feelings.

What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?","Assuming there are no medical explanations for this issue, many men I've worked with on this come to see it as essentially a form of Anxiety. There is a phenomenon called the Yerkes Dodson Law (see below; source: Wikipedia), which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress, pressure, or nervousness about a task, it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully. The ideal amount of stress/arousal is right in the middle - not too little and not too much. This applies to more things than we might often realize - from giving a presentation, to ordering food, to making a free throw, to driving, to sexual intimacy as in this case. A common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue, and for a temporary period of time, agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms, and without the expectation of intercourse. There are many ways to go about that (which are outside the scope of this blog article), but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety - and over time, can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive.

 ### Response: 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the distress and frustration you're experiencing with your recent loss of erectile function. It's completely understandable to feel devastated and concerned about the impact it's having on your marriage and self-esteem.

Loss of erectile function, also known as erectile dysfunction (ED), can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical, psychological, and lifestyle factors. Some common causes of ED include:

1. Aging: As men age, the blood vessels that supply the penis with blood can become less responsive, leading to difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection.
2. Heart disease: Heart disease can reduce blood flow to the penis, making it difficult to achieve an erection.
3. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves and blood vessels in the penis, leading to ED.
4. Prostate surgery: Surgery for prostate cancer or other prostate procedures can sometimes cause nerve damage that leads to ED.
5. Medications: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and blood pressure medications, can cause ED as a side effect.
6. Smoking: Smoking can damage the blood vessels and nerves in the penis, leading to ED.
7. Obesity: Obesity can increase the risk of ED by contributing to insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, all of which can damage the blood vessels and nerves in the penis.
8. Stress: Chronic stress can lead to ED by interfering with the body's ability to relax and respond to sexual stimulation.
9. Anxiety and depression: Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression can contribute to ED by interfering with the brain's ability to send signals to the penis.

It's important to note that ED is a common condition that can affect men of all ages, and it's not necessarily a sign of a serious underlying health problem. However, if you're experiencing persistent or recurring ED, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the problem.

In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help improve your erectile function:

1. Communication: Talk to your partner about your concerns and work together to find a solution.
2. Exercise: Regular exercise can improve blood flow and reduce stress, both of which can help improve erectile function.
3. Pelvic floor exercises: Strengthening the muscles in your pelvic floor can help improve blood flow and reduce the risk of ED.
4. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption: Both of these can damage the blood vessels and nerves in the penis, leading to ED.
5. Consider counseling: If you're experiencing emotional distress or relationship issues, consider seeking counseling or therapy to help address these issues.

Remember, ED is a common condition that can be treated and managed with the right support and resources. Don't be afraid to seek help and talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns.",49.335535764694214
"Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just don't know what to do anymore.

The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what she's going through, and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning. I would recommend looking for a therapist/counselor who works with children/adolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just don't know what to do anymore. She can be disrespectful and doesn't listen to or respect what we say. 

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable that you and your husband are concerned about your daughter's health, especially during the adolescent years when it can be challenging to maintain a healthy weight. As a parent, it's important to approach this issue in a supportive and non-judgmental manner, as it can be easy for children to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their weight.

Firstly, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your daughter about the importance of healthy eating habits and exercise. Avoid using language that is critical or blaming, as this can lead to feelings of low self-esteem and disengagement. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of healthy living, such as increased energy levels, better moods, and improved overall health.

It may also be helpful to involve your daughter in the process of creating a healthy meal plan and exercise routine. Encourage her to take an active role in meal planning and grocery shopping, and consider enrolling her in a fun exercise class or sport that she enjoys. By giving her a sense of ownership and control over her health, she may be more motivated to make positive changes.

Another important aspect to consider is the potential underlying causes of your daughter's overeating and disrespectful behavior. It's possible that she may be dealing with stress, anxiety, or other emotional issues that are contributing to her behavior. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns, and consider seeking professional help if needed.

Finally, don't be afraid to seek outside help and support if you feel like you're not making progress. Consider consulting with a registered dietitian or a therapist who specializes in working with children and adolescents. They can provide additional guidance and support to help your daughter develop healthy habits and improve her overall well-being.

Remember, it's important to approach this issue with empathy, understanding, and patience. With time, support, and consistency, your daughter can develop healthy habits and a positive relationship with food and exercise.",31.583743810653687

 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment? 

 ### Response: 

Finding the right therapist is a crucial step in the therapeutic process, as it can greatly impact the effectiveness of treatment. Here are some ways to know you have the right therapist for you:

1. **Personal compatibility**: It's essential to find a therapist with whom you feel comfortable and have a good rapport. This can be established through the initial consultation or first few sessions. If you feel like you're talking to a stranger or don't click with your therapist, it may be time to explore other options.
2. **Therapy style**: Different therapists subscribe to different therapeutic approaches or ""schools"" of thought. Find a therapist whose approach aligns with your preferences and needs. For example, some people prefer a more empathetic, supportive approach, while others prefer a more direct, challenging approach.
3. **Expertise**: Ensure your therapist has experience and training in the area you need help with. For instance, if you're struggling with anxiety, look for a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders.
4. **Communication**: A good therapist should be an effective communicator, both verbally and non-verbally. They should listen actively, clarify your concerns, and provide clear explanations and guidance.
5. **Empathy and emotional validation**: A good therapist should be able to empathize with you and validate your emotions. They should be able to understand your perspective and offer support and guidance without being judgmental.
6. **Goal-setting and progress tracking**: A good therapist should work with you to set realistic goals and track your progress. They should be able to help you identify and celebrate your achievements, while also being honest about areas that need improvement.
7. **Cultural sensitivity**: If you're from a diverse background or have specific cultural needs, look for a therapist who is culturally sensitive and competent. This can help you feel more comfortable and secure during treatment.
8. **Professional boundaries**: A good therapist should maintain appropriate professional boundaries. They should not engage in inappropriate or unethical behavior, such as overly familiar behavior or disclosing confidential information without your consent.
9. **Continuing education**: A good therapist should be committed to ongoing education and training. This can help them stay up-to-date with the latest research and techniques, ensuring they can provide the most effective treatment possible.
10. **Personal referrals**: Ask friends, family, or healthcare professionals for personal recommendations. This can help you find a therapist who has been vetted and has a good reputation.

To ""train"" your therapist, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and expectations. Here are some tips:

1. **Be clear about your goals**: Let your therapist know what you hope to achieve through treatment. Be specific about your goals and why they're important to you.
2. **Provide feedback**: Don't be afraid to give feedback to your therapist about their approach or style. If you're not comfortable with something, let them know.
3. **Ask questions**: If you don't understand something or want more information, don't hesitate to ask your therapist.
4. **Be an active participant**: Treatment is a collaborative process. Be an active participant by sharing your thoughts and feelings, and engaging in the therapeutic activities recommended by your therapist.
5. **Be patient**: Training your therapist takes time and patience. Don't expect them to ""fix"" everything overnight, but rather view treatment as a long-term process.

By following these tips, you can work with your therapist to create a personalized treatment plan that meets your needs and helps you achieve your goals. Remember, finding the right therapist and working with them effectively is a collaborative process that requires effort and commitment from both parties.",62.942760705947876
"I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.","The are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with. One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example ""I'm scared of spiders."" But if you change the thinking from being scared to ""I'm bigger than the spider,"" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. Mindfulness-based therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. Instead of avoiding distressing thoughts, open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.Although it may seem counter-intuitive, fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts. You can practice responding to disruptive thoughts, and letting these thoughts go.By remaining present in the body, you'll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats. By positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fight-or-flight response.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes. 

 ### Response:  It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a common mental health condition that can cause excessive and persistent worry about everyday things, even when there is no apparent reason to feel anxious. It can also lead to feelings of being overwhelmed and unable to cope with everyday situations. 

It's important to remember that anxiety is a treatable condition, and there are many effective therapies and strategies that can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that can be particularly helpful in addressing GAD. CBT can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety. 

In addition to therapy, there are also many self-help strategies that can help you manage your anxiety. These include:

* Deep breathing exercises: Deep breathing can help calm your body and mind, and can be done anywhere at any time.
* Progressive muscle relaxation: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, which can help you release physical tension and promote relaxation.
* Exercise: Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.
* Mindfulness meditation: This involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment, which can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings and can help you manage anxiety.
* Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and release them, and can also help you identify patterns and triggers of your anxiety.

It's important to remember that managing anxiety takes time and effort, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to do everything at once, and you can start with small steps that feel manageable to you. 

Remember, you are not alone in this, and there are many resources available to help you manage your anxiety. Don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.",32.07666349411011

Make an effort to thank the people who have helped you or supported you, and show your appreciation through small gestures like buying them a cup of coffee or sending them a kind message.
3. Be proactive: Don't wait for opportunities to build positive relationships - create them! Reach out to someone you've been wanting to connect with and make plans to spend time together. Whether it's a friend, family member, or coworker, taking the initiative to build a connection can help you foster a positive relationship.
4. Practice empathy: Being able to understand and relate to the feelings of others is a key component of building positive relationships. Take the time to really listen to what someone is saying and try to see things from their perspective. This can help you connect with people on a deeper level and build stronger relationships.
5. Be yourself: Authenticity is key in building positive relationships. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have. Be true to yourself and let your authenticity shine through. This can help you connect with people who appreciate you for who you are and can lead to deeper, more meaningful relationships.

Remember, building positive relationships takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run. By practicing these strategies and being consistent in your efforts, you can cultivate more positive relationships in the present and improve your overall well-being. 😊",31.129647970199585

 ### Response: 

I understand that you're feeling frustrated and helpless right now. It's completely normal to feel that way when things aren't going as planned. But let me tell you something, giving up is not the solution. In fact, it's often the opposite of what you should do.

When things get tough, it's important to dig deep and find the strength to keep going. It may seem impossible right now, but with persistence and determination, you can overcome any obstacle. Think about it this way: every great success story started with someone who refused to give up.

So instead of throwing in the towel, let's work together to find a solution. What have you tried so far? Maybe there's something we can build upon or improve. And if all else fails, we can always try something new. The important thing is to keep moving forward, no matter how small the step may be.

Remember, the only way to guarantee failure is to give up. But with a little bit of effort and determination, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. So let's keep going, shall we?",16.999627590179443

 ### Response: 

First of all, congratulations on taking the step to explore your sexuality and desires with your partner! It takes a lot of courage to do so, and it's great that you're both on the same page about it.

It's completely normal to feel a range of emotions when engaging in a new sexual experience, especially one that involves multiple people. It's possible that the initial excitement and anticipation of the threesome may have worn off, leaving you feeling a bit empty or unsure about how you feel. This is totally okay, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't enjoy the experience or that you're not comfortable with it.

One reason you might be feeling this way is because of the dynamics involved in a threesome. As you mentioned, your husband was more focused on the other person than you, which can be a bit disorienting and make you feel left out or ignored. It's important to communicate your feelings and boundaries with your partner beforehand, so that everyone is on the same page and can work together to make sure everyone is comfortable and enjoying themselves.

Another reason you might be feeling empty is because of the emotional weight of the experience. Engaging in a threesome can bring up a lot of emotions, including feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and vulnerability. It's important to take the time to process and work through these emotions after the experience, whether that's through talking to your partner or engaging in some solo reflection time.

It's also worth considering the cultural and societal expectations that surround threesomes. Unfortunately, there are a lot of misconceptions and stigmas surrounding this type of sexual activity, which can make it difficult to feel comfortable and confident in your desires. By talking openly and honestly with your partner, you can work together to break down these barriers and create a more positive and accepting environment for your sexual exploration.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about how you're feeling. It's okay to feel unsure or empty after a threesome, and it's important to take the time to work through these emotions together. By being open and honest with each other, you can create a more positive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.",34.777143239974976
"I am a teenage girl. I've been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I don't remember anything about this dream. I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?","There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it? 

 ### Response:  It's not uncommon for people to experience recurring dreams, especially during times of stress or change in their lives. The fact that you've been having this same dream since you were young suggests that it may be a reflection of some deep-seated emotional or psychological issue. However, without more information about your dream, it's difficult to say for sure what might be causing it.

One possible explanation for why you can't remember your dream is that your brain is processing the information in a way that doesn't allow for consolidation of memories. This can happen due to various factors such as stress, lack of sleep, or certain medical conditions.

Another possibility is that your dream is a manifestation of your subconscious mind, trying to communicate something to you. Dreams can be a way for our mind to process and deal with emotions, experiences, and thoughts that we may not be able to consciously confront.

To try to remember your dream, you could try keeping a dream journal. Write down as soon as you wake up any details you can remember about your dream, no matter how small they may seem. This can help you to better understand the themes and emotions that are present in your dreams and may help you to remember them more clearly.

You could also try practicing mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to help you relax and focus your mind. This can help you to become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, including those that may be manifesting in your dreams.

It's also possible that talking to a therapist or counselor could help you to better understand the underlying issues that may be causing your recurring dream. A mental health professional can help you to explore these issues in a safe and supportive environment.

In summary, the reasons why you see the same dream and can't remember it are complex and multifaceted. By exploring these issues with a mental health professional and practicing techniques to help you remember your dreams, you may be able to gain a deeper understanding of your subconscious mind and emotions.",31.377514600753784

 ### Response: 

Finding the right therapist can be a daunting task, but there are several ways to determine if you have found the right therapist for you. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. Trust and rapport: Do you feel comfortable and trust your therapist? A good therapist should make you feel safe and supported, and you should feel able to be open and honest with them.
2. Personal compatibility: Is your therapist someone you can relate to and connect with? You should feel like you can be yourself around them and that they understand your experiences and perspectives.
3. Therapeutic approach: Does your therapist use a therapeutic approach that aligns with your needs and preferences? Different therapists specialize in different areas, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or interpersonal therapy.
4. Communication style: Is your therapist an effective communicator? They should be able to listen actively, clarify your concerns, and provide clear and concise explanations of their approach and techniques.
5. Goal-setting: Does your therapist work with you to set and achieve goals that are important to you? They should be willing to work with you to develop a treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and concerns.

As for ""training"" your therapist, it's important to remember that therapists are trained professionals who have spent years studying and developing their skills. While you may be able to provide feedback and suggestions for how your therapist can better support you, it's not possible to ""train"" them in the same way you might train a pet or a personal assistant.

Instead, it's important to focus on building a collaborative relationship with your therapist. This means being open and honest about your needs and concerns, and working together to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs.

Here are some ways you can work collaboratively with your therapist:

1. Be open and honest: Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with your therapist in a non-judgmental and respectful manner.
2. Set goals together: Work with your therapist to set specific, measurable goals that are important to you.
3. Experiment with different techniques: Try different therapeutic techniques and strategies with your therapist, and provide feedback on what works best for you.
4. Be proactive: Take an active role in your therapy by asking questions, sharing your thoughts and feelings, and advocating for yourself.

Remember, finding the right therapist and building a collaborative relationship takes time and effort. Be patient, communicate openly and honestly, and work together to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs.",42.286463499069214

It's important to remember that finding your purpose and direction in life is a process that can take time, and it's okay to feel stuck in the meantime.

 ### Response: 

I understand that you are concerned about this person's behavior and the potential harm it could cause. Lying about every aspect of one's life is a serious issue, especially when it involves manipulating and deceiving others, including creating fake relationships. It's important to address this situation in a responsible and supportive manner.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that lying and manipulation can have severe consequences, not only for the person being lied to but also for the person engaging in the behavior. It can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and even mental health issues.

In this case, the person has created three fake relationships, which is a red flag for a deeper issue. The most recent one is particularly concerning, as it involves a married man with kids. This behavior can lead to a breakdown of trust and respect in relationships, and it's important to address it before it escalates further.

It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Rather than attacking or judging the person, it's important to have an open and non-judgmental conversation about their behavior. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Choose a good time and place to talk: Find a private and comfortable setting where you can have an uninterrupted conversation. Make sure you're both comfortable and in a good headspace.
2. Express your concerns: Start by expressing your concerns in a non-accusatory manner. Use ""I"" statements to describe how you feel and avoid making assumptions or accusations. For example, ""I'm worried about you because you've been lying about your relationships. It's important to be honest and respectful in our interactions.""
3. Listen actively: Listen carefully to the person's response and show empathy and understanding. Avoid interrupting or judging them, and try to see things from their perspective.
4. Offer support: Let the person know that you're there to support them and offer help if they need it. Encourage them to seek professional help if they're struggling with lying or other mental health issues.

 ### Input: I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they've had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never done eating dessert. 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to have a strong desire for food, especially sweet treats. However, it's important to practice self-control and moderation when it comes to consuming food. Overeating can lead to a range of negative health consequences, including weight gain, digestive problems, and an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

One strategy you can use to help manage your food cravings is to practice mindful eating. This involves paying attention to your hunger and fullness cues, and eating slowly and savoring your food. This can help you feel more satisfied with smaller portions and reduce the likelihood of overeating.

Another approach is to find healthy alternatives to your favorite sweet treats. For example, if you're craving dessert, try reaching for a fruit or a small piece of dark chocolate instead. These options can provide a similar sweet taste without the negative health consequences of consuming too much sugar.

It's also important to consider the emotional reasons behind your food cravings. Are you using food as a way to cope with stress or other emotions? If so, finding healthier ways to manage these emotions, such as through exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend, can help reduce your cravings for unhealthy foods.

Remember, it's okay to indulge every now and then, but it's important to practice self-control and moderation when it comes to consuming food. By being mindful of your eating habits and making healthier choices, you can enjoy food without compromising your health.",24.374147176742554

 Finding the right therapist is a crucial step in the therapeutic process, as it can significantly impact the effectiveness of treatment. Here are some ways to determine if you have found the right therapist for you:

2. **Expertise:** Ensure the therapist has experience and training in the area you need help with. For instance, if you're struggling with anxiety, look for a therapist who specializes in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
3. **Personal connection:** A strong therapeutic relationship is built on trust, empathy, and mutual understanding. Look for a therapist who listens actively, provides feedback, and offers supportive guidance.
4. **Therapy style:** Consider the therapist's approach to treatment. Some therapists may use a more direct and structured approach, while others may adopt a more flexible and adaptive approach. Find a therapist whose style aligns with your preferences and needs.
5. **Communication:** Effective communication is vital in therapy. Ensure the therapist communicates clearly, provides regular updates, and is responsive to your needs and concerns.
6. **Goal alignment:** It's crucial to find a therapist who shares your goals and is committed to helping you achieve them. Make sure the therapist is willing to work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs.
7. **Flexibility:** Consider the therapist's availability and willingness to accommodate your schedule and preferences. A flexible therapist can help you stay motivated and committed to treatment.
8. **Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate your progress and the therapist's effectiveness. If you don't feel like you're making progress or if you have concerns about the therapist's approach, it may be time to seek a second opinion or switch therapists.

To ""train"" your therapist, it's essential to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and expectations. Here are some tips:

1. **Be specific:** Provide clear and detailed information about your symptoms, experiences, and goals. This can help the therapist tailor their approach to your unique needs.

3. **Provide feedback:** Offer constructive feedback on the therapist's approach and any progress you've made. This can help the therapist adjust their approach and ensure you're getting the most out of treatment.
4. **Be consistent:** Consistency is key in therapy. Attend sessions regularly and maintain open communication with the therapist to ensure the best possible outcome.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It sounds like you feel like you're putting in a lot of effort and not getting the same level of commitment from your boyfriend when it comes to making decisions and planning dates. It's understandable to feel frustrated when you feel like you're doing more work than your partner in a relationship.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that trust is a two-way street. While it's great that your boyfriend treats you nice and checks on you, it's also important for him to be invested in the relationship and willing to work together to make decisions and plan dates. It's not fair to carry the entire load of the relationship on your own.

One way to approach this situation is to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you're feeling. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking him. For example, you could say something like, ""Hey, I've noticed that I tend to do more of the planning and decision-making in our relationship, and I feel like I'm putting in more effort than you. I want us to work together and make decisions that feel good for both of us. Can we find a way to do that?""

It's also important to communicate your needs and expectations in the relationship. If you want to go on more dates or make more decisions together, let him know. If you feel like he's not meeting your needs, it's important to address that directly and find a solution together.

In terms of compromise, it's important to find common ground and work together to find solutions that feel good for both of you. This might involve sacrificing some of your own desires for the sake of the relationship, or finding ways to compromise and find middle ground.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it takes effort and commitment from both partners to make it work. By communicating openly and honestly, and working together to find solutions, you and your boyfriend can build a stronger and more equal relationship.",32.032875299453735

It sounds like your son is struggling with a common issue known as ""video game addiction"" or ""digital media overuse."" This can be a challenging issue to address, as it can be difficult to break the cycle of excessive gaming and screen time. However, there are some strategies you can try to help your son manage his gaming habits and reduce the frequency of accidents.

First, it's important to understand the reasons behind your son's behavior. Is he using gaming as a way to cope with stress or anxiety? Is he feeling lonely or isolated and turning to gaming as a way to connect with others? Once you understand the underlying reasons for his behavior, you can develop a plan to address them in a healthier way.

Here are some strategies you can try:

1. Set limits: Establish a daily limit on the amount of time your son can spend gaming. This can be a challenging task, but it's important to set clear boundaries and enforce them consistently.
2. Encourage other activities: Introduce your son to other hobbies and activities that he can engage in instead of gaming. This can help him develop a more balanced routine and reduce his reliance on gaming.
3. Practice mindfulness: Teach your son mindfulness techniques that can help him become more aware of his gaming habits and how they impact his life. This can help him develop self-awareness and self-regulation skills.
4. Seek professional help: If your son's gaming habits are causing significant problems in his life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. A therapist can work with your son to identify the underlying issues driving his behavior and develop strategies to manage them.

Remember, it's important to approach this issue with empathy and understanding. Avoid punishing or shaming your son for his behavior, as this can exacerbate the problem. Instead, work with him to develop a plan that addresses the underlying issues and promotes healthier habits. With patience, consistency, and support, you can help your son develop a more balanced and healthy relationship with gaming.",32.82018828392029

 ### Response: 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal for couples to have varying levels of sexual desire and satisfaction. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique needs, desires, and communication styles, and it's okay if yours don't align perfectly.

It's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to work on it. The fact that you're willing to have an open and honest conversation about it is a great starting point.

Rather than focusing solely on the number of times you're having sex, I would suggest exploring the reasons behind your low sex drive. Are there any underlying issues or stressors that could be contributing to it? Are there any unmet emotional or physical needs that could be contributing to your feelings of disconnection?

It's important to have a holistic approach to addressing this issue. This could involve having open and honest conversations with your husband about your needs and desires, as well as exploring ways to reconnect and strengthen your emotional bond.

One strategy could be to set aside dedicated time for intimacy and connection, such as a weekly date night or a regular ""couples' time"" where you can focus on each other and your relationship. This could involve doing things that you both enjoy, such as going for a walk, cooking a meal together, or practicing a shared hobby.

Another strategy could be to explore new ways of connecting and being intimate. This could involve trying new positions or techniques, or exploring new forms of intimacy such as sensual massage or erotic touch.

It's also important to remember that sexual intimacy is just one aspect of a healthy relationship. It's important to prioritize other forms of connection and intimacy, such as emotional support, shared activities, and communication.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to prioritize your own needs and desires, and to communicate them openly and honestly with your husband. By working together to address any underlying issues and prioritize connection and intimacy, you can strengthen your relationship and improve your overall well-being.",32.60560917854309

 ### Response: 

Dear [User],

Thank you for sharing your personal story with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such a sensitive and personal topic, and I appreciate your trust in me.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that losing one's virginity can be a complex and emotional experience, especially for a Christian teenage girl. It's important to remember that your worth and identity are not defined by your sexual choices or experiences. You are so much more than your sexual history, and you are loved and valued by God regardless of what has happened.

It's understandable that you may feel guilty or uncertain about your relationship with your boyfriend after losing your virginity. However, it's important to remember that God's love and grace are available to you, regardless of your mistakes or choices. He is a merciful and compassionate God who desires to restore and heal your heart, not condemn or judge you.

It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. It may be helpful to have a conversation with him about your values and beliefs, and to seek clarity on where he stands on these issues as well. It's also important to prioritize your own emotional and spiritual well-being, and to seek support from trusted friends, family, or a professional counselor if needed.

In terms of your question about whether your boyfriend is the one God planned for you, I would encourage you to focus on building a deep and meaningful connection with him based on shared values, mutual respect, and a commitment to God's will. Rather than trying to fit into a specific mold or expectation, seek to understand and follow God's plan for your life and your relationship.

Remember, God's plan for your life is not limited to a specific person or relationship. His plan is to bring you into a deeper relationship with Himself, and to use you for His purposes in the world. So, even if your current relationship doesn't work out, know that God has a plan to prosper you and not to harm you, to give you hope and a future (Jeremiah 29:11).

Finally, I want to encourage you to keep dreaming and hoping for a potential future together with your boyfriend. While it's important to prioritize your own emotional and spiritual well-being, it's also okay to have hope and dreams for the future. God can use your relationship to bring you closer to Himself and to bring you joy and fulfillment in your life.

In conclusion, know that you are loved and valued by God, and that He is with you every step of the way. Seek to build a deep and meaningful connection with your boyfriend based on shared values and mutual respect, and trust in God's plan for your life and your relationship.",43.406818151474

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now, and I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable that you would feel scared and uncertain after something as significant as a breakup, especially when it felt sudden and unexpected. It's natural to feel like you're not yourself anymore, and it's okay to feel like you're not trusting people as easily as you used to. It takes time to heal and rebuild those feelings of trust and comfort, but it's important to remember that you're not alone in this process.

One thing that might be helpful is to try and identify the sources of your fear and discomfort. Are there specific situations or interactions that are causing you to feel this way? Are there any particular triggers that you can avoid or manage? By understanding what's causing your feelings, you might be able to start addressing them directly and finding ways to feel more comfortable and at ease.

It's also important to remember that healing is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. You don't have to feel like yourself again right away – in fact, it's okay if you don't feel like yourself for a while. Give yourself permission to feel however you're feeling, and try not to put too much pressure on yourself to ""get over"" the breakup or to be a certain way. Instead, focus on taking care of yourself and doing things that make you feel good, both physically and emotionally.

One thing that might help is to try and find ways to connect with others in a way that feels safe and comfortable for you. This might mean reaching out to close friends or family members, or it might mean joining a support group or finding a therapist who can help you work through your feelings. It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone – there are people who care about you and want to help.

Finally, try to be kind to yourself and to your emotions. It's okay if you don't feel like yourself right away – in fact, it's normal. Give yourself time and space to heal, and try not to be too hard on yourself if you don't feel like you're making progress as quickly as you'd like. Remember that healing is a process, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on taking care of yourself and doing things that make you feel good.",36.97677135467529
"I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes. I've either been barely sleeping or I over sleep, so I'm always tired. I live in a small town, so there's no one I can really talk to because I'm not really that close with my family.","Hello, and thank you for your question. You are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too.

First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all
else. 
To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other people’s actions. There are various
reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that
person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe
it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for, not the other way around. 
As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school. 
You may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some
states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concerned
about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. 
If you don’t know a counselor, think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas. 
Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able
to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random
searches, not every website is good, so be careful. 
This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the
things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If
you have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care
of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help when
we get stressed. 
I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck.

 ### Input: I'm a teenage girl, and my dad is an alcoholic. I hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out. He can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons, and half of the time, I don't even know if he's sober or not. I refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. Living with an alcoholic parent can be incredibly stressful and emotionally draining, and it's completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed and exhausted. It's important to remember that you don't have to face this alone, and there are resources available to help you cope with the situation.

Firstly, it's important to prioritize your own safety and well-being. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe around your dad when he's drinking, it's okay to set boundaries and avoid being alone with him when he's intoxicated. You have the right to feel safe and respected in your own home, and it's important to prioritize your own needs and emotional well-being.

It might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or family friend, about what you're going through. They can provide emotional support and help you find ways to cope with the situation. You might also consider joining a support group for teenagers who are dealing with similar issues. These groups can provide a safe and confidential space to talk about your experiences and connect with others who understand what you're going through.

In addition to seeking support from others, it's important to take care of yourself. This might include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and finding healthy ways to manage stress and anxiety. It's also important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being, and to seek professional help if you're struggling to cope with the situation.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are people and resources available to help you navigate this difficult situation, and you deserve to feel safe and supported.",27.687744140625

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and helpless in this situation. Your wife's constant accusations of cheating and disrespectful behavior can be emotionally draining and damaging to your relationship. Here are some suggestions that may help you address this issue and improve communication with your wife:

1. Practice active listening: When your wife brings up her concerns, make sure to listen attentively to what she's saying. Avoid interrupting or dismissing her feelings, and try to understand her perspective. Show her that you're taking her concerns seriously and that you're willing to work together to find a solution.
2. Be honest and open: It's important to be transparent about your intentions and feelings. Let your wife know that you're not trying to cheat on her, and explain how certain actions or words may have unintended consequences. Be willing to listen to her concerns and work together to find a compromise.
3. Identify the root cause: It's possible that your wife's accusations are stemming from deeper issues, such as insecurity or past trauma. Try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how her feelings may be impacting your relationship. Offer support and encouragement as she works through these issues.
4. Set boundaries: It's important to establish clear boundaries in any relationship. Let your wife know what behaviors are and aren't acceptable, and be firm but respectful in enforcing those boundaries.
5. Seek outside help: If you've tried addressing the issue on your own and it's still not improving, consider seeking outside help. A couples therapist or counselor can provide a neutral perspective and help you and your wife work through your issues.

Remember, improving communication and trust in a relationship takes time and effort from both parties. It's important to be patient, understanding, and willing to work together to find a solution. With time and effort, you and your wife can build a stronger, more respectful relationship.",30.380343437194824

Is this normal? 

 ### Response: 

It is completely normal for parents to have different levels of attachment and bonding with their children, especially when they are of different ages. It is common for parents to feel a stronger connection with their oldest child, as they have had more time to develop this bond. Additionally, the oldest child may be more independent and self-sufficient, which can make it easier for parents to form a close relationship with them.

It is also normal for parents to feel overwhelmed or tired with a newborn, especially if it is their third child. Caring for a newborn can be challenging and tiring, and it is common for parents to feel a sense of relief when their baby naps or is otherwise occupied. This does not necessarily mean that you do not love or care for your youngest child, but rather that you may be feeling the strain of caring for multiple young children at once.

It is important to remember that it is okay to have different levels of attachment and bonding with each of your children. It is normal for parents to have a favorite child, but it is also important to make sure that all of your children feel loved and valued. One way to do this is to spend quality time with each child individually, doing activities that they enjoy and that help to strengthen your bond with them.

It may also be helpful to talk to your partner or a trusted friend or family member about how you are feeling. They may be able to offer support and advice on how to manage your feelings and care for all of your children. Remember, it is okay to ask for help when you need it, and it is important to take care of yourself as well as your children.

In summary, it is normal for parents to have different levels of attachment and bonding with their children, and it is okay to feel overwhelmed or tired with a newborn.

 ### Response:  It sounds like your boyfriend has a pattern of using the silent treatment and sarcasm to handle conflicts in your relationship. This can be incredibly challenging to navigate, and it's important to address the issue in a constructive way. Here are some suggestions:

1. Communicate directly and assertively: When you feel comfortable, try talking directly to your boyfriend about how his behavior is affecting you. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking him. For example, you could say, ""I feel hurt and frustrated when you give me the silent treatment for days without telling me what's wrong. It makes me feel like you're not willing to communicate openly and honestly with me.""
2. Set boundaries: It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations in the relationship. Let your boyfriend know that you will not engage in a conversation that involves name-calling or personal attacks. Instead, focus on finding a resolution to the issue at hand.
3. Seek outside support: If you're finding it difficult to address the issue on your own, consider seeking outside support from a couples therapist or counselor. A professional can help you and your boyfriend communicate more effectively and work through conflicts in a healthy way.
4. Practice self-care: Dealing with a partner who uses the silent treatment and sarcasm can be emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of yourself by engaging in activities that bring you joy, practicing relaxation techniques, and spending time with supportive friends and family.
5. Consider the underlying issues: It's possible that your boyfriend's behavior is a symptom of deeper issues, such as insecurity or fear of vulnerability. Encourage him to explore these issues with a therapist or counselor, and offer your support in his journey towards healing and growth.

Remember, addressing conflicts in a relationship takes time, effort, and patience.

I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl. 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable to feel uncomfortable in your own body, especially when societal expectations and gender norms can make it difficult to reconcile your inner identity with your outer appearance. It's important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and it's not uncommon for people to feel like they don't quite fit into the traditional gender categories.

It's great that you're thinking about and exploring your feelings, and it's important to remember that you don't have to conform to societal expectations or norms in order to be comfortable in your own body. It's okay to be different, and it's important to find a sense of self-acceptance and self-love.

It's also important to consider the ways in which societal expectations and norms can be limiting and harmful, and to think about how you can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting environment for everyone. This can involve challenging traditional gender roles and expectations, and advocating for greater understanding and acceptance of gender diversity.

In terms of your specific situation, it's important to remember that you don't have to change your gender identity in order to feel more comfortable in your body. It's okay to be who you are, and to find ways to express yourself and feel comfortable in your own skin. This might involve exploring different ways of expressing your gender, such as through fashion, makeup, or other forms of self-expression. It might also involve finding supportive and understanding friends and community, who can help you feel more comfortable and confident in your identity.

Overall, it's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling, and that there are many resources and support available to help you navigate your feelings and find a sense of self-acceptance and self-love. Don't be afraid to reach out and seek help if you need it, and know that you are deserving of love and respect, regardless of your gender identity.",30.207741737365723
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Hello and thanks for your question! It's important to have the right therapist. I encourage you to start by checking out the website of the therapist. Their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you. If there's an email listed, go ahead and reach out. Ask the particular questions that are on your mind. Share a little of what you are looking for in a therapist. Are you a goal-direct, solution-focused individual who is looking for someone to listen and ask questions? Are you less self-directive and desire a therapist who can give you the consistent push to move forward? Are you interested in intertwining certain theory approaches? Maybe a cognitive-base or experiential? Art therapy or engaging in exercise while talking? Your therapist is out there. It's OK to try out a therapist for a session or two. Interview them as they interview you. It's also OK to change therapists; ask your present therapist for a referral. He or she should be willing to provide you with names of other providers and there's no shame in asking for it. You deserve to work with someone who fits your style!I imagine there's already enough things happening in your life if you are searching for a therapist. Do you really want to ""train"" your therapist? After all, you are paying them for their knowledge and expertise. It does take time to develop a relationship and developing one with your therapist is vital to your growth and satisfaction. Participating in therapy, for the most part, should be a time you anticipate and not avoid. Can you be honest with them? Are you trusting of the confidentiality they provide? Has this person clearly shared with you the limits of confidentiality if using insurance versus paying privately? Is there any part of you that ""just isn't sure""? It's okay to assert yourself in therapy. As a therapist, I invite you to assert yourself as it's a way to develop self-confidence and resiliency. Not everyone thrives in therapy by sitting in an office or lounging on a couch. Some folks benefit by challenging themselves in various environments, or are more comfortable in their homes, online, in the community, at a retreat, etc. Give yourself a gift of spending some time finding the person that can work with you towards what you are searching. Although there's the convenience of the local non-profit agency in your area, it may not be what you need. Also, limiting yourself to the names of providers listed on your insurance may not lead to the ""right one"". There are many forms of therapy that insurances refuse to cover. When this happens, many times you can be reimbursed for your expenses by your insurance or you can use a Health Savings Card or Flexible Spending Card, there are many, many options. Therapy is about exploring yourself. Go ahead and feel free!If you feel as if you need to ""train"" your therapist, it seems that person is not the right fit for you.

4. Good Chemistry: A good therapeutic relationship is built on good chemistry. Consider whether you feel like you click with your therapist, and whether you feel like you can be yourself around them.
5. Availability and Accessibility: Ensure that your therapist is available and accessible to you. Consider their schedule, location, and mode of communication. Make sure you can reach them easily and that they are responsive to your needs.

 ### Input: I've been having horrible anxiety for the last week. I can't sleep. I get a sense of doom, and it's hard to breathe. I feel like nothing I do makes it better. 

 ### Response:  Sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and helpless when dealing with anxiety. It can be a really isolating and scary experience, but please know that you're not alone. 

First of all, it's important to recognize that anxiety is a common and treatable condition. Many people experience anxiety at some point in their lives, and there are many effective therapies and techniques that can help you manage your symptoms.

One thing that can be helpful is to try and identify the sources of your anxiety. Are there any specific situations or triggers that seem to make your anxiety worse? Once you can identify these triggers, you can start working on ways to avoid or cope with them. For example, if you find that you get anxious when you're in public places, you might try practicing deep breathing exercises or meditation to help you relax in those situations.

Another important thing to remember is that you don't have to go through this alone. Talking to a therapist or counselor can be a great way to get support and learn new coping strategies. They can help you develop a plan to manage your anxiety and work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to your symptoms.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are also some things you can try on your own to help manage your anxiety. Exercise, for example, can be a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Even a short walk or some light stretching can help. You can also try practicing mindfulness techniques, such as focusing on your breath or a mantra, to help you stay present and centered.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and scared when dealing with anxiety. It's important to be kind to yourself and to take things one step at a time. Try not to be too hard on yourself, and don't give up hope. With time and effort, you can learn to manage your anxiety and feel more like yourself again.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional distress, and it's understandable that you might feel like you're internally screaming all the time. It's important to recognize that you're not alone in this feeling, and that there are resources available to help you manage and cope with these emotions.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience emotional distress and feelings of being a ""caged animal"" without being able to identify the source of their distress. It's possible that you might be experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition such as anxiety or depression, which can make it difficult to manage emotions and feel like you're constantly on edge.

It's important to reach out to a mental health professional for support and guidance. A therapist or counselor can help you identify the underlying causes of your emotional distress and develop coping strategies to manage your emotions. They can also provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to process your feelings and work through them.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are also some things you can try on your own to help manage your emotions. Practicing self-care and self-compassion can be incredibly helpful in reducing emotional distress. This can include activities such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. It's also important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, and to take time for yourself when you feel overwhelmed.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel emotional distress, and that it's normal to feel like you're a ""caged animal"" at times. Recognizing that these feelings are normal and valid can be incredibly helpful in reducing feelings of shame or guilt around your emotions.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Reaching out for support and seeking help when you need it can be incredibly powerful in managing emotional distress and feeling more like yourself.",31.32191276550293

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're facing a difficult situation, and it's important to prioritize the well-being and safety of yourself and your child. Given the unbearable relationship you have with your mother and the lack of support from your fiancé, it may be best to consider moving away with your child to a safe and stable environment.

Living in a negative environment with constant arguing and negativity can have a significant impact on a child's mental and emotional health, and it may be better for them to live in a more stable and supportive environment.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your fiancé about your concerns and the potential impact on your child. It may be helpful to explore options for co-parenting or finding a new living arrangement that works for everyone involved.

In the meantime, it may be helpful to seek out support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you navigate this difficult situation. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone, and there are resources available to help you and your child.

 ### Response: 

 Sorry to hear that you're struggling with severe anxiety. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and like everything makes it worse. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you manage your anxiety.

Firstly, it's great to hear that you have an emotional support animal (ESA) that helps you feel better. ESAs are trained to provide comfort and emotional support to individuals with mental or emotional disabilities, and they can be a valuable tool in managing anxiety. However, it's important to note that ESAs are not a replacement for professional mental health treatment.

Have you considered seeking help from a mental health professional? They can work with you to develop coping strategies and provide support in managing your anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common form of therapy used to treat anxiety disorders, and it can be very effective in helping you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are also some lifestyle changes you can make to help manage your anxiety. Exercise is a great way to reduce anxiety, as it can help release endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga can help you calm your mind and body.

It's also important to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This can include things like reading, listening to music, or spending time with loved ones.

Remember, managing anxiety takes time and effort, but it is possible to feel better with the right support and strategies. Don't be afraid to reach out for help and support from professionals, loved ones, or support groups. You don't have to go through this alone.

3. Focus on your strengths: Instead of dwelling on your weaknesses, focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Identify your strengths and find ways to highlight them in your presentation.
4. Take deep breaths: Before you start presenting, take a few deep breaths to calm your nerves. This can help slow down your heart rate and reduce any anxiety you may be feeling.

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to have questions and doubts about the afterlife, especially when it comes to the idea of living forever. It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the concept of an eternal existence, regardless of whether it's in a positive or negative environment.

It's important to remember that religion and spirituality are complex and multifaceted, and there are many different interpretations of what happens after we pass on. It's okay to have your own doubts and questions, and it's important to be honest with yourself and your beliefs.

It sounds like you and your son are going through a difficult time, and I can understand why you're feeling frustrated and unsure of how to handle the situation. It's important to recognize that your son is going through a challenging phase of his life, and he may be struggling to find his way.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your son's behavior is not uncommon among teenagers. Adolescence is a time of identity formation, and many young people struggle with feelings of disrespect and rebelliousness as they try to assert their independence. It's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, rather than resorting to punitive measures.

One approach you could consider is having an open and honest conversation with your son about your concerns. It's important to listen to his perspective and try to understand why he's behaving in this way. You may find that there are underlying issues that need to be addressed, such as feelings of insecurity or low self-esteem. By listening to his concerns and offering support, you may be able to help him find a more positive path forward.

Another option is to seek the help of a therapist or counselor who can work with both you and your son to address the underlying issues and develop strategies for improving communication and behavior. A professional can provide a safe and neutral space for your son to express himself and can offer guidance on how to manage his emotions and behaviors in a healthy way.

It's also important to remember that you can't control your son's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. Rather than resorting to punitive measures, try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. By setting clear boundaries and offering support, you may be able to help your son find a more positive path forward.

In terms of specific steps you can take, here are a few suggestions:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your son about your concerns. Try to listen to his perspective and offer support.
2. Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who can work with both you and your son to address underlying issues and develop strategies for improving communication and behavior.
3. Set clear boundaries and consequences for unacceptable behavior, while also offering support and encouragement for positive behavior.
4. Encourage your son to take responsibility for his actions and to make amends when he has caused harm.
5. Offer support and resources for your son to pursue his interests and passions, such as hobbies or extracurricular activities.

Remember, parenting a teenager can be challenging, but with empathy, understanding, and the right support, you can help your son find a more positive path forward.",41.61716938018799

I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it? 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about how you're feeling, especially when it comes to something as personal as your identity. It's completely normal to feel lost or unsure of yourself after having children and getting married. Many women experience this same feeling, and it's important to remember that it's okay to feel this way.

First of all, let's talk about the idea that you've ""lost your identity"" as a mom and wife. It's important to recognize that your identity is not just one thing - it's made up of many different parts, including your relationships, your values, your interests, and your personality. Just because you're a mom and wife doesn't mean that you can't also be other things. In fact, many women find that their roles as mothers and wives actually enhance their sense of identity and purpose.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel unhappy or trapped at times. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by the responsibilities of parenthood and marriage, especially when you're first starting out. It can take time to find a rhythm and a sense of balance that works for you and your family. The key is to be patient with yourself and to be willing to make changes as needed.

One thing that might be helpful is to think about what you're passionate about and what brings you joy. What are some things that you love to do, even if it's just for a few minutes a day? This could be anything from reading a book to taking a walk to practicing yoga. By making time for these things, you can start to reconnect with your own identity and find a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Another thing you might want to try is to set aside some time each day to focus on yourself. This could be as simple as taking a relaxing bath or practicing deep breathing exercises. By taking care of yourself, you can start to feel more grounded and centered, which can help you feel more confident and happy in your role as a mom and wife.

Finally, it's important to remember that you don't have to do everything alone. Reach out to friends and family for support, or consider joining a support group for new moms and wives. It can be helpful to talk to other women who are going through similar experiences and to find ways to connect and support each other.

In summary, it's okay to feel lost or unsure of yourself as a mom and wife. It's normal to feel overwhelmed and unhappy at times, but there are many things you can do to find a sense of identity and purpose. By taking care of yourself, making time for your passions, and reaching out for support when you need it, you can start to feel more confident and happy in your role. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and to be patient with yourself as you navigate this new chapter in your life.",45.099745750427246

 ### Input: My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left. 

 ### Response: 

Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that you went through such a difficult experience. Breaking up is never easy, especially when it's due to someone else's actions. It's understandable that you kept forgiving him, hoping that things would get better, but it's important to recognize when it's time to let go.

It takes a lot of courage to admit when someone has hurt us, and it's even harder to do so when we've invested so much emotionally in the relationship. But it's important to remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and honesty, and that you don't have to settle for anything less.

It's okay to feel angry, hurt, and confused after a breakup like this. It's normal to question your own worth and to wonder if there was anything you could have done differently. But try not to be too hard on yourself – remember that you're not alone in this feeling, and that many people have gone through similar experiences.

Take some time to focus on yourself and your own well-being. Do things that make you happy, whether that's spending time with friends and family, pursuing a hobby, or simply taking care of yourself. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and it's okay to take time for yourself to figure that out.

Remember that healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't feel like yourself right away – give yourself the time and space you need to heal. And don't be afraid to reach out for support from those around you – whether that's friends, family, or a professional counselor – when you need it.

You are strong and capable, and you will get through this difficult time. Remember to be kind to yourself and to take things one step at a time. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and with time and support, you will get there.",30.36761784553528
"I know I'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make. I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just can't seem to even though I really want to. Why can't I force myself to change?","Hello, and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, ""I want to be more confident"" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help.

 ### Input: I know I'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make. I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just can't seem to even though I really want to. Why can't I force myself to change? 

 ### Response: 

It's great that you're aware of the issues you're facing and want to make changes. However, forcing yourself to change can be challenging, especially if you're struggling with deeply ingrained habits or beliefs. Here are some reasons why you might find it difficult to make lasting changes:

1. Lack of motivation: You might be aware of the changes you need to make, but you might not have enough motivation to drive you to take action. This can be due to various reasons, such as feeling overwhelmed, lack of support, or feeling like you're not ready to make the changes.
2. Fear of failure: Change can be scary, especially if you're not sure if it will work out. You might be afraid of failing or making things worse, which can hold you back from making changes.
3. Comfort zone: Change can take you out of your comfort zone, which can be uncomfortable and even painful. You might be resistant to change because it requires you to step outside of your comfort zone and try new things.
4. Lack of self-awareness: You might not be aware of the underlying reasons for your behaviors or habits. Until you understand why you're making the choices you are, it can be difficult to change them.
5. Perfectionism: You might be holding yourself to unrealistic standards, which can make it difficult to change. You might feel like you need to make perfect changes, which can lead to procrastination and inaction.
6. Lack of support: Change can be difficult, especially if you don't have a support system to help you through the process. You might feel like you're alone in your struggles, which can make it harder to make changes.
7. Unrealistic expectations: You might be setting unrealistic expectations for yourself, which can lead to disappointment and frustration when you're unable to meet them.
8. Fear of the unknown: Change can involve stepping into the unknown, which can be scary. You might be afraid of what might happen if you make changes, which can hold you back from taking action.

To overcome these challenges, it's important to approach change in a gradual and sustainable way. Here are some strategies you can use:

1. Start small: Instead of trying to make big changes all at once, start with small, manageable steps. This can help you build momentum and confidence.
2. Set realistic goals: Set specific, achievable goals for yourself, and break them down into smaller steps. This can help you stay motivated and focused.
3. Seek support: Surround yourself with people who support and encourage you, and seek professional help if you need it.
4. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes or encounter setbacks. Remember that change is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.
5. Celebrate small wins: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant. This can help you stay motivated and build confidence.
6. Be patient: Change takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through the process.
7. Focus on progress, not perfection: Instead of striving for perfection, focus on making progress towards your goals. This can help you stay motivated and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

Remember, change is a process, and it takes time and effort to make lasting changes. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you work through the process, and don't be afraid to seek help when you need it.",55.73423218727112
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender.

 ### Input: I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender. 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and honest about your gender identity, especially when it doesn't align with societal expectations. It's completely understandable to feel confused and unsure about how to label yourself, especially when it comes to something as complex and personal as gender.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that gender is a spectrum, and there is no one ""right"" way to identify or express it. Many people identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or genderfluid, which means they don't identify as exclusively male or female. Others may identify as genderfluid, meaning their gender identity shifts or changes over time. There is no one ""right"" way to experience or express gender, and that's okay.

It's also important to remember that your gender identity is yours to claim and express, and no one else's opinion or label can take that away from you. You don't have to label yourself or conform to societal expectations if you don't feel comfortable doing so. It's okay to simply say ""I don't feel comfortable labeling myself"" or ""I'm still figuring things out.""

If someone asks your gender and you're not sure how to respond, you could try saying something like ""I prefer not to label myself with a specific gender. I'm still exploring and learning about my own identity."" Or, ""I don't feel comfortable labeling myself with a specific gender. I'm just trying to figure things out."" It's okay to take your time and be patient with yourself as you navigate your gender identity.

Remember, your gender identity is yours to own and express, and no one else's opinions or labels can take that away from you. You are valid and deserving of respect and support, no matter how you choose to identify or express yourself.",28.284104824066162

 ### Response: 

Firstly, congratulations on taking the step to explore your sexual desires and boundaries with your partner! It's completely normal to feel a range of emotions, including the one you're experiencing, after engaging in a new sexual activity.

It's important to recognize that threesomes can be a sensitive topic, and it's natural for feelings of insecurity or discomfort to arise, especially when there are power imbalances or unequal levels of enthusiasm among the parties involved.

It's great that you and your husband had an open and honest conversation about your feelings after the threesome. Communication is crucial in any sexual relationship, and it's important to continue having these conversations to ensure that everyone's needs and desires are being met.

The empty feeling you're experiencing could be due to a number of factors. It could be a result of the initial excitement and anticipation wearing off, or it could be a sign that you're grappling with deeper emotions and questions about your sexual identity or relationship dynamics.

Here are a few things you could consider to help you work through these feelings:

1. Take some time to reflect on your feelings: Try journaling or talking to a trusted friend or therapist about your emotions. Ask yourself why you're feeling this way, and what you can do to address these feelings.
2. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that make you feel good, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.
3. Communicate with your partner: Share your feelings with your husband and be open to hearing his perspective. Together, you can work on finding ways to address these feelings and continue exploring your sexual desires in a way that feels comfortable and enjoyable for both of you.
4. Consider couples therapy: If you're struggling to work through these feelings on your own, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for you and your husband to explore your feelings and work on your relationship.

Remember, it's okay to feel unsure or uncomfortable after engaging in a new sexual activity. It's important to prioritize your emotional well-being and communicate openly and honestly with your partner. With time and effort, you can work through these feelings and continue to explore your sexual desires in a way that feels healthy and fulfilling for both of you.",38.3638858795166

Therapy is a safe space where individuals can express their emotions and work through challenging experiences, and it is normal for people to feel emotional during this process.

Crying during therapy can serve several purposes. It can be a way to release and process emotions, such as sadness, anger, or frustration, that have been building up over time. It can also be a way to communicate and express feelings that may be difficult to put into words. Additionally, crying during therapy can be a sign of emotional release and catharsis, which can help individuals feel lighter and more relaxed after a session.

It is important to remember that crying during therapy is not a sign of weakness or vulnerability. It is a natural and normal response to the therapeutic process, and it can be a sign of progress and growth. Many people find that crying during therapy helps them to feel more connected to their emotions and to gain a deeper understanding of themselves.

If you are feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious about crying during therapy, it may be helpful to talk to your therapist about your feelings. They can provide support and reassurance, and help you to feel more comfortable expressing yourself in a safe and non-judgmental space.

 ### Response: 

It's completely normal to experience imposter syndrome, especially in a challenging and competitive environment like graduate school. Despite your achievements and the positive feedback you've received, it's common to feel like an imposter or a fraud, especially when you're surrounded by talented and accomplished peers. Here are some strategies that may help you overcome this feeling and build your confidence:

1. Acknowledge and accept your feelings: The first step is to recognize and accept that you're experiencing imposter syndrome. Don't try to deny or suppress these feelings, as they can be a sign that you're pushing yourself too hard or that you're not taking care of yourself. By acknowledging your feelings, you can start to address the root causes and work on strategies to overcome them.
2. Reframe your thinking: Challenge the negative self-talk and replace it with positive affirmations. Instead of focusing on your perceived shortcomings, focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Remind yourself of your achievements and the reasons why you were accepted into graduate school in the first place.
3. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, just as you would towards a friend who's struggling. Remind yourself that everyone experiences imposter syndrome at some point in their lives, and that it's okay to feel this way. Offer yourself support and encouragement, and try to reframe setbacks as opportunities for growth.
4. Seek support from others: Talk to your peers, mentors, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your experiences with others can help you feel less alone and more supported.

"My dad is always, and I mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. He makes me feel stupid. He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. Is this abuse?","I'm really sorry to hear that you are going through this.It's a little difficult to answer your question because the laws that define child abuse are different from state to state. But usually, things like what you describe your dad is doing are not considered to be child abuse.The more important thing is how you feel about what is going on. It sounds like this is really bothering you.If you don't think you can talk to your dad about how you feel, you might want to try talking to another adult you trust (like a family member or teacher). They may be able to help you figure out some ways to communicate with your dad.I think you might feel better if you can talk to someone about how your are feeling.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My dad is always, and I mean always, cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all. He makes me feel stupid. He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me. Is this abuse? 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you feel upset and belittled by your father's behavior. Being constantly criticized and compared unfavorably to your siblings can be incredibly hurtful and damaging to your self-esteem. While it may not necessarily meet the legal definition of abuse, it is still emotionally abusive and can have long-lasting effects on your mental health.

Emotional abuse is any behavior that can cause emotional harm or distress to another person. It can take many forms, including criticism, belittling, manipulation, and isolation. In your case, your father's constant cussing and screaming at you, as well as his comparisons to your siblings, are all examples of emotionally abusive behavior.

It's important to remember that you don't deserve to be treated this way. You are a valuable and worthy person, and you don't have to tolerate abusive behavior from anyone, including your father. It's okay to stand up for yourself and set boundaries with him, even if it's difficult.

One way to start setting boundaries is to have a calm and respectful conversation with your father about how his behavior is affecting you. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking him. For example, you could say, ""Dad, I feel really hurt and upset when you yell at me and compare me to my siblings. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. Can we find a way to communicate that doesn't make me feel this way?""

If you're not comfortable having this conversation with your father directly, you could consider talking to a trusted family member or friend, or seeking out professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with emotional support and help you develop strategies for dealing with your father's behavior.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. There are people and resources available to help you navigate this difficult situation. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to advocate for yourself and your own emotional well-being.",32.89340853691101
"I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad.

 ### Response: 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the immense courage it takes for you to share your story with me. It's not easy to relive painful memories and emotions, especially when it comes to experiences of abuse. I commend you for your bravery and resilience in facing this challenge head-on.

It's completely understandable that you would feel hurt and frustrated by your youngest daughter's behavior, especially after all the sacrifices you made for her and your other children as a single mom. It's important to recognize that your daughter's behavior is not a reflection of your worth or value as a parent. Children often struggle with complex emotions and loyalties, especially when it comes to their parents' divorce and the involvement of different family members.

It's important to maintain open and honest communication with your daughter, and to express your feelings and concerns to her in a non-accusatory manner. Here are some suggestions for how to handle this situation:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Explain to her how you feel when she calls you crazy and favors her dad. Be specific about the emotions you experience and why it hurts you. Avoid blaming or attacking her, and instead focus on your own feelings and experiences.
2. Listen to your daughter's perspective. Ask her why she feels the way she does and what she needs from you. Try to understand her feelings and concerns, even if you don't agree with them. Listening actively and empathetically can help to build trust and understanding.
3. Set boundaries. It's important to establish clear boundaries and expectations for how you want to be treated and how you want your daughter to behave towards you. Let her know that you will not tolerate being called crazy or disrespected, and that you expect to be treated with respect and kindness.
4. Seek support from other family members or a therapist. It can be helpful to have a neutral third party to talk to and to get support and guidance on how to handle this situation. Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who specializes in family dynamics and conflict resolution.
5. Practice self-care. It's important to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Make sure to prioritize your own emotional well-being, engage in activities that bring you joy, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.

Remember, handling conflicts and emotions in a healthy and constructive way takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and your daughter, and keep working towards building a stronger and more loving relationship.",39.90531325340271
"I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.","Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say ""I need answers to all my questions"". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say ""I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth."" Only time (and a good therapist, if she is willing and wants the marriage) will tell which way this one will go. Individually, you can seek professional help as well.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt and betrayed by your wife's actions. It's important to remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and honesty in a relationship, and it's not okay for someone to lie to you or ignore your concerns.

It's understandable that your wife may be feeling defensive or ashamed about her infidelity, but that doesn't excuse her behavior towards you. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns with her in a calm and respectful manner, and to listen to her perspective as well.

It may be helpful to have a third party, such as a therapist or counselor, present to help facilitate the conversation and provide support. It's important to be clear and direct about your feelings and needs, and to be willing to listen to your wife's perspective as well.

Remember that healing and rebuilding trust in a relationship takes time and effort from both parties. It's important to be patient, understanding, and willing to work together to build a stronger, more honest relationship.

In the meantime, it's important to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. It's okay to feel upset, angry, or sad, and it's important to give yourself time to process your emotions and grieve the loss of your relationship.

My boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. He says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. He says he should have had more sex with different people. I don't know how to handle this.,"I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles. One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be. In time, the right person for you will enter your life.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. He says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. He says he should have had more sex with different people. I don't know how to handle this. 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that your boyfriend is struggling with your promiscuous past, and it's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and empathy. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and pasts, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of jealousy or insecurity in relationships.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge your boyfriend's feelings and concerns. It's okay to feel upset or uncomfortable when someone you love is struggling with something that makes them feel uncomfortable or disgusted. However, it's important to communicate with him in a calm and respectful manner, and to avoid making him feel ashamed or embarrassed about his feelings.

One way to approach this topic is to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your past. You can explain to him why you made the choices you did in the past, and how you have grown and learned from those experiences. It's important to be honest and vulnerable in this conversation, as it can help to build trust and understanding between you and your boyfriend.

It's also important to remember that your past does not define your worth or identity. You are more than your past experiences, and you are worthy of love and respect regardless of what you did in the past. It's important to communicate this to your boyfriend, and to remind him that he loves you for who you are now, not for your past mistakes.

In terms of how to handle this situation, it's important to prioritize communication and honesty in your relationship. This means being open and honest with each other about your feelings and concerns, and working together to find a solution that works for both of you. It may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support in navigating this complex issue.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and pasts, and it's okay to have differences and disagreements in a relationship. What's important is that you and your boyfriend are able to communicate and work together to find a solution that works for both of you. With empathy, honesty, and communication, it's possible to overcome this challenge and build a stronger, more loving relationship.",34.955817461013794

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about sexual preferences, especially when they differ from what is considered ""normal."" It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique preferences and desires, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to sexual intimacy.

It's completely normal to feel hesitant or uncomfortable during sexual activity, especially if it's not something that you enjoy. It's important to communicate your feelings with your partner in a respectful and empathetic manner. It may be helpful to explain to them how you feel and why, and to work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

It's also important to remember that sexual intimacy is not the only way to connect with your partner. There are many other ways to show affection and build a strong relationship, such as through conversation, shared activities, and emotional support.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to approach this topic with your partner, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with additional support and guidance.

If you are a child or teenager, this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. A lot of people, unfortunately, do not, and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time. By this I mean a sex change. Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly. Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis. Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes.

It's completely understandable to feel uncomfortable in your own body, especially when society's expectations don't align with your own identity. It's important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and it's okay to feel like you don't fit into the gender category that was assigned to you at birth.

It's great that you're exploring your feelings and thoughts about your gender identity, and it's important to be honest with yourself about how you feel. It's okay to feel like you don't identify with traditional gender categories, and it's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling. Many people experience gender dysphoria, which is a feeling of distress or discomfort that can occur when a person's gender identity does not align with the gender they were assigned at birth.

It's important to remember that you have the right to express your gender in a way that feels authentic and comfortable to you. This might involve exploring different gender expressions, such as dressing in a way that feels more feminine or masculine, or using different pronouns to refer to yourself. It's also important to remember that you don't have to change your body to align with your gender identity. Many people find comfort and relief in their body, even if it doesn't align with their gender identity.

It's also important to consider seeking support from mental health professionals, such as a therapist or counselor, who can help you work through your feelings and provide a safe and supportive space to explore your gender identity. They can also help you find resources and support to help you navigate your gender identity in a way that feels comfortable and authentic to you.

Remember, you are not alone in this feeling, and there are many resources available to help you explore and express your gender identity in a way that feels authentic and comfortable to you.",28.65757179260254

Firstly, it's completely understandable that you feel uncomfortable and disrespected by your boyfriend's father's actions. It's important to remember that you have the right to privacy and boundaries in your own home, and it's not okay for someone to enter your home without your permission.

Here are some steps you can take to address this situation:

1. Have a calm and respectful conversation with your boyfriend: It's important to talk to your boyfriend about how you feel and why his father's actions are unacceptable. Try to approach the conversation in a non-confrontational way and avoid blaming or attacking his father. Instead, focus on how his father's behavior is impacting you and your relationship.
2. Set clear boundaries: It's important to communicate your boundaries to your boyfriend and his father. Let them know that you will not tolerate unannounced visits or entering your home without your permission. It's okay to be firm and assertive when setting boundaries, and it's important to be consistent in enforcing them.
3. Consider installing a lock: If your boyfriend's father continues to enter your home without your permission, you may want to consider installing a lock on your front door. This can help to protect your privacy and give you peace of mind.
4. Seek support from your boyfriend: It's important to have your boyfriend's support in setting boundaries and standing up to his father. He should be able to understand and respect your feelings, and he may be able to help mediate the situation with his father.
5. Consider seeking outside help: If the situation is not improving and you feel like you're not able to set boundaries or protect your privacy, you may want to consider seeking outside help. This could include talking to a therapist or counselor, or seeking legal advice.

 ### Response: 

It's great to hear that you're thinking of showing your appreciation for your counselor's help with a thoughtful gift! Giving a gift of wine from your country can be a nice gesture, especially if your counselor enjoys wine. However, it's important to consider a few things before deciding on a gift.

Firstly, it's important to be mindful of cultural differences and potential sensitivities. While wine is a popular gift in many cultures, it may not be appropriate or respectful to give alcohol as a gift in some contexts, such as in a professional setting or to someone who doesn't drink alcohol.

Secondly, you may want to consider your counselor's personal preferences and tastes. If they don't drink wine or prefer a different type of beverage, you could consider giving a gift that reflects their interests or tastes.

Finally, you may want to consider the timing of your gift. Giving a gift after Christmas may be seen as inappropriate or insensitive, especially if your counselor is from a different cultural background or has different religious beliefs. It's important to be mindful of cultural norms and traditions when giving gifts.

In summary, giving a gift of wine from your country can be a nice gesture, but it's important to consider cultural sensitivities, personal preferences, and the timing of your gift. You may want to consider other gift options that are more universally appreciated, such as a nice card or a small token of appreciation.",23.70308566093445

It's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and wanting to have sex with your boyfriend after he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles.

 ### Input: My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers. The next day, she kicked me out. She let me move back two days later. Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. I asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says it's not my business. 

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're feeling confused and concerned about your wife's sudden change of heart regarding your relationship. Asking about her contact with a male friend of hers may have inadvertently caused tension in your marriage, and it's possible that she felt uncomfortable or defensive about it.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries and comfort levels when it comes to their relationships, and it's possible that your wife may have felt like you were crossing a line by asking about her friend. Instead of jumping to conclusions or making assumptions about the other guy, it may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings and concerns.

You could try saying something like, ""Hey, I know we've been having some issues lately, and I want to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I know I asked about your contact with a male friend of yours, and My apologies for doing that. I just wanted to know if everything was okay between us, but I realize now that it's not my business. Can we talk about what's going on between us and see if there's anything we can do to work through it?""

By approaching the conversation in a calm and respectful manner, you may be able to find a way to move forward and work on rebuilding your marriage. It's important to remember that communication and empathy are key in any relationship, and being willing to listen and understand each other's perspectives can go a long way in resolving conflicts.",23.4054913520813
I have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month.,"There's a narrative approach that we call nightmare ""rescripting"" that may be helpful.Since we can't really control the nature of our dreams while they're happening, we try to alter them while we are in a waking state.  In a nutshell, this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have. Typically, there is an element of fear, danger or helplessness.Second, we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment, control, competence, and/or safety. In other words, if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted, we might change the events of the story so that you call the police, get to a place of safety, or even fight back and protect yourself.Third, you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again, so that it becomes a well rehearsed story. The effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping, this new, more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream. Best of luck!","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

It sounds like your friend is going through a difficult time managing her diabetes and dealing with the emotional attachment issues that come with it. It's not uncommon for individuals with type one diabetes to experience emotional challenges, as they often have to cope with the reality of living with a chronic illness that requires constant monitoring and management.

It's important to recognize that your friend's anger and demands to go back to her prior home may be a sign of her struggles with her diagnosis. It could be that she is feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with the constant monitoring and management of her diabetes, and is seeking comfort in the familiarity of her prior home.

As a supportive friend, there are a few things you can do to help your friend during this challenging time:

1. Listen and validate her feelings: It's important to create a safe and non-judgmental space for your friend to express her feelings. Listen to her without interrupting or judging, and validate her emotions. Let her know that it's okay to feel upset and frustrated, and that you're there to support her.
2. Offer emotional support: Provide emotional support by being present and available to your friend. Offer words of encouragement and reassurance, and remind her that she's not alone in this struggle. Let her know that you're there to support her and that you'll work together to find a solution.

5. Be patient and understanding: Living with a chronic illness like diabetes can be incredibly challenging, and it's important to be patient and understanding with your friend. Avoid putting pressure on her to ""get over it"" or ""move on,"" as this can exacerbate her emotional struggles.

It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right?

A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there.

Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on? 

 ### Response:  It sounds like you may be experiencing a common phenomenon known as ""mood swings"" during your teenage years. Mood swings are periods of time when a person's mood changes rapidly and unpredictably, often influenced by hormonal changes in the body. As a teenager, your body is going through many changes as you grow and develop, and these changes can sometimes lead to mood swings.

It's important to understand that mood swings are a normal part of growing up, and they can affect anyone, regardless of their gender or age. During this time, it's common to experience a range of emotions, including irritability, frustration, and sadness. These feelings can be intense and can sometimes make it difficult to focus or make decisions.

In your case, it seems like you may be experiencing a combination of emotions that are causing your mood swings. When you have a certain idea or goal in mind, it's natural to feel excited and motivated to make it happen. However, when others intervene or things don't go as planned, it can be frustrating and lead to feelings of blame or irritation.

It's important to remember that you can't control how others behave or what happens in life, but you can control how you react to these situations. Instead of blaming others, try to focus on finding ways to manage your emotions and stay calm in difficult situations. This can help you stay in control of your emotions and make better decisions.

There are several strategies you can try to help manage your mood swings:

1. Practice deep breathing exercises: When you feel yourself getting irritated or frustrated, take a few deep breaths and focus on your breathing. This can help calm your body and mind.
2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help release tension and improve your mood. Find an activity that you enjoy, such as running, dancing, or playing a sport, and make it a regular part of your routine.
3. Talk to a trusted friend or family member: Sometimes just talking to someone about how you're feeling can help you feel better. Find someone you trust and feel comfortable talking to, and share your feelings with them.
4. Write in a journal: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and gain perspective. Try writing in a journal each day to help you stay in touch with your emotions.
5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment and focusing on your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Try practicing mindfulness through meditation or other activities to help you stay calm and focused.

Remember, mood swings are a normal part of growing up, and they will eventually pass. By learning how to manage your emotions and stay calm in difficult situations, you can develop the skills you need to navigate these challenges and live a happy and fulfilling life.",44.561848640441895

I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex. 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about these kinds of feelings, especially when it comes to something as personal and intimate as sex. It's important to remember that sex is a normal and natural part of life, and it's okay to have feelings of nervousness or insecurity about it.

First of all, let's address the idea that you're not a virgin. It's important to remember that a person's sexual history is their own business, and it's not something that you need to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. Everyone has their own unique experiences and experiences, and there's no one ""right"" way to approach sex.

It's also important to remember that your partner is probably not thinking about your virginity status at all. They're probably more focused on getting to know you and connecting with you on a deeper level. So, try not to worry too much about what they might think of you – instead, focus on enjoying the experience and being present in the moment.

Another thing to keep in mind is that sex is a two-way street. It's not just about you and your partner – it's about communication, mutual respect, and consent. So, make sure you're communicating openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and boundaries, and make sure you're both on the same page.

Finally, remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace. If you're feeling nervous or unsure about having sex, it's perfectly fine to slow things down or take a break. Your partner should respect your boundaries and be understanding of your feelings.

In short, try not to be too hard on yourself, and remember that communication and mutual respect are key to a healthy and enjoyable sexual experience.",27.679508686065674

 ### Response: 

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Losing someone you love can be incredibly difficult, and it's completely normal to struggle with processing those emotions. It's understandable that you might feel like you can't smile or fake happiness, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed by your emotions.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people have experienced the loss of a loved one and have gone through similar struggles. It can be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings, as they can provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your emotions. They can also offer coping strategies and techniques to help you manage your feelings and work through your grief.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are some things you can try on your own to help manage your emotions. One thing that can be helpful is to find ways to honor and remember your loved one. This could be something as simple as lighting a candle or saying a prayer, or it could be something more involved like creating a memory book or making a donation in their name. Finding ways to honor your loved one can help you feel more connected to them and can be a way to keep their memory alive.

Another thing you might consider is practicing self-care. This can be as simple as taking a few moments each day to do something that brings you joy, like listening to music or taking a walk. It's important to take care of yourself during this time, as grief can be incredibly draining.

Finally, it might be helpful to try to focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past. This can be difficult, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, but it can help you find some sense of peace and stability. You might try practicing mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay present and focused.

 ### Input: Example would be homecoming? I was at my high school's home football game on Friday, and I left because I felt uncomfortable with all the people there and I just wanted to be by myself. Why is that? 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to feel uncomfortable in crowded situations, especially when you're surrounded by a lot of people you don't know. Homecoming is a big event, and it can be overwhelming to be around so many people at once. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and need some time to yourself. It's important to prioritize your own comfort and well-being, especially in situations that make you feel anxious or uncomfortable.

It's possible that you may be experiencing some social anxiety or sensory overload in these situations. Social anxiety is a common condition where people feel nervous or uncomfortable in social situations, and it can be triggered by crowded events like homecoming. Sensory overload can occur when someone is exposed to too much sensory information, such as loud noises, bright lights, and crowds of people. These conditions can make it difficult to feel comfortable and relaxed in these situations.

If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable in crowded situations like homecoming, there are a few things you can try to help manage your feelings. One strategy is to take breaks and step away from the crowd for a little while. This can help you recharge and feel more comfortable when you return. You can also try practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your nerves and reduce your anxiety.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries. If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable, it's okay to take a step back and set boundaries for yourself. This might mean finding a quiet spot to sit and recharge, or excusing yourself to take a break. It's important to communicate your needs and boundaries with those around you, so they can understand and respect them.

In summary, it's completely normal to feel uncomfortable in crowded situations like homecoming. It's important to prioritize your own comfort and well-being, and to communicate your needs and boundaries with those around you. With some practice and self-care, you can learn to manage your feelings of discomfort and enjoy these events in a more enjoyable way.",33.71555733680725
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?","Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. That's a complex injury. I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"". It's about saying ""It happened. I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. It only adds to yours. Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life. If you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this? 

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're feeling angry and resentful towards your ex-partner after all these years. Seeing their posts about how great their life is can be particularly hurtful, especially if you're still grappling with the emotional fallout of the breakup. Here are some suggestions that may help you manage your feelings and move forward:

1. Allow yourself to feel your emotions: It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings, rather than suppressing or denying them. Don't try to numb yourself or avoid thinking about how you feel. Instead, take a few moments each day to reflect on your emotions and give yourself permission to feel whatever arises.
2. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, just as you would towards a close friend. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel hurt and angry, and that these feelings are a normal part of the healing process.
3. Set boundaries: If seeing your ex's Facebook posts is causing you significant distress, it may be helpful to limit your exposure to them. You can unfollow or block them on social media, or take a break from using these platforms for a while.
4. Focus on self-care: Take care of yourself by engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This could include exercise, meditation, reading, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing a hobby you're passionate about.
5. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist for emotional support. Talking to someone who understands can help you process your feelings and gain a new perspective on the situation.
6. Practice gratitude: Make a conscious effort to focus on the good things in your life, rather than dwelling on your ex's happiness. Reflect on the positive experiences and relationships you have, and express gratitude for these blessings.
7. Consider therapy: If you're finding it difficult to manage your emotions and move on from the breakup, consider seeking professional help from a therapist. They can provide you with additional support and guidance as you navigate this challenging time.

Remember, healing from a breakup takes time, patience, and self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself the space to feel and heal. With time, you'll learn to manage your emotions and move forward in a positive direction.",36.71488118171692

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that addiction is a complex and challenging issue, and it's admirable that your boyfriend is taking steps towards recovery. However, it's understandable that you're feeling distant and unsure of how to fix the relationship during this time.

One thing you can do to support your boyfriend during this time is to be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on him to ""fix"" the relationship or to ""get over"" his addiction quickly. Instead, offer your support and encouragement as he works towards recovery.

Here are some ways you can support your boyfriend during his recovery:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about addiction, its causes, and its treatment options. This will help you understand what your boyfriend is going through and how you can best support him.

Firstly, I understand that trust is a crucial aspect of any relationship, and it's completely normal for couples to face trust issues from time to time. However, it's important to address these issues in a constructive and respectful manner.

It's great that you're willing to be open and honest about your feelings, and I encourage you to continue doing so. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to listen to each other's perspectives and work towards finding a solution that works for both parties.

 ### Response:  Sorry to hear that you're facing difficulties with your mom. It can be challenging to deal with a controlling parent, especially when they refuse to listen to your perspective. Here are some suggestions that may help you navigate this situation:

1. Set clear boundaries: It's essential to establish clear boundaries with your mom to maintain your independence and autonomy. Let her know what you are and are not comfortable with in terms of her control over your life. Be assertive but respectful in communicating your boundaries.
2. Practice active listening: When you do have conversations with your mom, make sure to actively listen to what she has to say. Give her your undivided attention, and try to understand her perspective. This can help her feel heard and understood, which may reduce her need to control you.

7. Focus on your goals: Remember that you have your own goals and aspirations. Focus on achieving them, and don't let your mom's controlling behavior hold you back. Set small, achievable goals for yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way.
8. Practice assertiveness: Learn to communicate your needs and feelings assertively but respectfully. Use ""I"" statements to express your thoughts and feelings, and avoid blaming or attacking language.
9. Take a break: If the situation becomes too overwhelming, take a break from your mom for a while. Set boundaries around your interactions with her, and prioritize your own emotional well-being.
10. Seek support from your dad or other family members: If possible, seek support from your dad or other family members who may be more understanding and supportive. They can provide emotional support and help you find ways to cope with your mom's controlling behavior.

 ### Input: I keep being mean to my best friend, and I don't know why all the time. I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time. Could that be a cause? 

 ### Response: 

It's possible that your behavior towards your best friend is linked to your mother's behavior towards you, but it's important to consider other factors as well. Being mean to someone can be a coping mechanism for unresolved emotional issues or a way to deflect attention from one's own feelings. It could also be a learned behavior from childhood experiences or a pattern of behavior that you've developed over time.

It's important to reflect on your feelings and motivations when treating your best friend poorly. Are you feeling stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed? Are there certain situations or triggers that cause you to act this way? Identifying the underlying reasons for your behavior can help you address them and find healthier ways to manage your emotions.

It may also be helpful to communicate with your best friend about how their behavior is affecting you. Be honest and respectful in your communication, and try to find a solution that works for both of you. Remember, a healthy relationship involves mutual respect, empathy, and open communication.

In addition to addressing the root causes of your behavior, it's important to prioritize self-care and self-compassion. Practice self-kindness, engage in activities that bring you joy, and seek support from loved ones or a mental health professional if needed.

Remember, you have the power to change your behavior and develop healthier coping mechanisms. With time and effort, you can work towards building a stronger, more positive relationship with your best friend and yourself.",22.88391089439392

 ### Response: 

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your struggles with intrusive thoughts. It's completely normal to experience unwanted thoughts from time to time, and it can be especially challenging when they feel like they're coming from outside of yourself.

Firstly, it's important to understand that intrusive thoughts are not a reflection of your worth or identity. They are simply a product of your brain's tendency to wander and generate thoughts, often without any logical or rational basis. These thoughts are not a personal attack on you, and they do not define your worth as a person.

It's also worth noting that intrusive thoughts are not uncommon, and many people experience them to some degree. They can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, anxiety, and certain mental health conditions.

To manage these thoughts, there are several strategies you can try:

1. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts and emotions in the present moment without judgment. By focusing on the present moment, you can learn to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them. This can help you develop a sense of detachment from intrusive thoughts and reduce their impact.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you notice an intrusive thought, try to challenge it by asking yourself if it's really true. Are there any evidence or logical reasons to support the thought? Can you reframe the thought in a more positive or neutral way? By challenging these thoughts, you can learn to replace them with more balanced and realistic ones.
3. Use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of therapy that can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. A therapist can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your intrusive thoughts and develop strategies to manage them.
4. Practice self-compassion: It's important to be kind and compassionate towards yourself when dealing with intrusive thoughts. Remember that these thoughts are not a reflection of your worth, and they don't define your identity. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, and try to cultivate a sense of self-compassion.
5. Seek support: Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can be a helpful way to manage intrusive thoughts. Sharing your experiences and feelings with someone you trust can help you feel less alone and more supported.

Remember, managing intrusive thoughts takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be afraid to seek help if you need it. With time and practice, you can learn to manage these thoughts and improve your overall mental well-being.",40.69305372238159

 ### Input: Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies? 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to question one's beliefs and to admit that you're struggling with doubts. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when there are so many conflicting ideas and beliefs in the world.

Firstly, let me assure you that it's okay to have doubts and questions about God. Many people have gone through similar struggles and have come out the other side with a deeper understanding and faith in God. It's important to remember that faith is a journey and not a destination, and it's okay to take your time and explore different perspectives before coming to any conclusions.

One way to approach this question is to look at the evidence for God's existence. Many people find comfort and evidence for God's existence in the beauty and complexity of the natural world, the resilience and compassion of human relationships, and the transformative power of spiritual practices like prayer and meditation.

However, it's also important to recognize that there are many different perspectives and interpretations of God, and there is no one ""right"" way to understand or believe in God. Some people may find comfort in a personal, loving God who is actively involved in their lives, while others may find meaning and purpose in a more distant or impersonal deity.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to believe in God is a deeply personal and subjective one, and it's okay to take your time and explore different perspectives before coming to any conclusions. What's most important is that you find a belief system that brings you comfort, meaning, and purpose, and that allows you to live a life that is authentic and fulfilling to you.

 ### Response: 

 Sorry to hear that you're struggling with these conditions and facing challenges in finding adequate medical care and support. As an AI language model, I understand the importance of seeking professional help for managing mental health issues, and I would recommend the following steps:

1. **Broaden your search**: Don't limit yourself to just your local area. Look for mental health professionals in neighboring cities or towns, or even online therapists who offer teletherapy sessions. You can use online directories or search engines to find qualified therapists, psychologists, or psychiatrists in your state or region.
2. **Ask for referrals**: Reach out to your friends, family, or support groups for recommendations on mental health professionals they have worked with in the past. You can also ask your primary care physician for referrals or recommendations.
3. **Check with your insurance**: Contact your insurance provider to find out which mental health professionals are covered under your plan. This can help you narrow down your search to professionals who are affordable and accessible.
4. **Consider online therapy**: Online therapy sessions can be a convenient option for those who have difficulty accessing in-person therapy due to location or mobility issues. Many therapists offer online sessions, and some platforms even offer sliding-scale fees or accept insurance.
5. **Take care of yourself**: In the meantime, focus on self-care activities that help you manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. This can include exercise, meditation, journaling, or creative activities that bring you joy.
6. **Seek emergency assistance**: If you're in immediate crisis or need urgent help, you can contact a crisis hotline or emergency services in your area.

Remember, finding the right mental health professional takes time and effort, but it's worth it to get the help you need. Don't give up hope, and keep searching until you find someone who is a good fit for you.",30.59317684173584

It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and I can understand why you would want to take a step back and focus on your personal situations. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness, especially when it comes to romantic relationships.

It's great that you and your partner have been talking every day, but it's also important to have healthy communication and boundaries in a relationship. If he gets mad over small things and doesn't talk to you for a while, it can create a lot of tension and stress.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling and what you need from the relationship. You can express your concerns and feelings to him, and listen to his perspective as well. It may be helpful to set some boundaries and expectations for how you want to communicate and interact with each other.

It's also important to remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it's okay to take a break or step back if you need to. It's better to be honest and direct about your needs than to continue feeling unhappy or unfulfilled in the relationship.

How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and angry when someone you love is struggling with a degenerative condition like Alzheimer's. The constant requests for unrealistic, silly, or meaningless items can be particularly challenging, especially when it becomes clear that your mother is not able to remember or use these items in a practical way.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that your feelings are valid and normal. Coping with a loved one's Alzheimer's can be incredibly difficult, and it's okay to feel frustrated, angry, or guilty at times. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and find healthy ways to manage them.

One strategy is to prioritize self-care and find ways to manage your own emotions and well-being. This might involve taking breaks from caring for your mother, engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, or seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.

Another approach is to try to find ways to communicate with your mother in a way that is meaningful and comforting to her. This might involve using visual aids, such as pictures or drawings, or using memory aids, such as a photo album or a reminder app. You could also try to engage your mother in activities that she enjoys and that bring her pleasure, even if they are not practical or realistic.

It's also important to remember that your mother's behavior is not a personal attack on you or anyone else. Alzheimer's is a degenerative condition that affects the brain and can lead to changes in mood, behavior, and cognitive function. While it can be challenging to deal with these changes, it's important to approach them with empathy and understanding.

Finally, consider seeking support from other caregivers who are going through similar experiences. Joining a support group or connecting with other caregivers online can provide a sense of community and understanding, as well as practical tips and strategies for coping with the challenges of Alzheimer's caregiving.

In summary, coping with a loved one's Alzheimer's can be incredibly difficult, but it's important to prioritize self-care, find ways to communicate and connect with your mother, and seek support from others who are going through similar experiences. By taking care of yourself and seeking support, you can find ways to manage your feelings of frustration and anger and find meaning and purpose in your caregiving journey.",37.303136348724365
"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone.

It does mean that the two of you may need to spend some time to find out what you both like. Instead of looking at it as a rejection, look at it as a challenge, an adventure that the two of you can go on as explorers together.

 ### Input: I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone? 

 ### Response:  It's completely normal to feel lonely at times, especially when there are a lot of things on your mind. It's important to remember that you don't have to face these feelings alone. Reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can provide you with emotional support and help you feel less alone.

 ### Response: 

Finding the right therapist is a personal and crucial decision that can significantly impact the success of your treatment. Here are some key factors to consider when selecting a therapist:

1. Credentials and Experience: Ensure the therapist has the necessary education, training, and experience to treat your specific concerns. Check their credentials, such as licensure, certifications, and years of experience.
2. Comfort and Trust: Establish a good rapport with the therapist. You should feel comfortable sharing personal information and feel trustworthy in their ability to help you. A good therapist should be empathetic, non-judgmental, and respectful.
3. Therapeutic Approach: Consider the therapist's theoretical orientation and approach to treatment. Look for someone who practices an evidence-based therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or interpersonal therapy.
4. Communication: Evaluate the therapist's communication style. They should be able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, listen actively, and provide regular updates on your progress.
5. Availability and Location: Ensure the therapist has convenient hours and a location that is accessible to you. Online therapy sessions are also an option for those with busy schedules or mobility issues.
6. Personal Connection: A good therapist should be able to connect with you on a personal level. They should be able to understand your unique experiences, values, and goals, and tailor their approach accordingly.
7. Flexibility: Look for a therapist who is flexible and willing to adapt their approach as needed. Treatment plans should be tailored to your individual needs and evolve as you progress.
8. Continuity of Care: Ensure the therapist has a plan in place for continuity of care, including how they will handle emergencies or unexpected events.
9. Professional Organizations: Check if the therapist is a member of professional organizations, such as the American Psychological Association (APA) or the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). This can indicate their commitment to ethical practice and ongoing professional development.
10. Personal Preference: Lastly, choose a therapist who you feel personally comfortable with. This can help ensure you are more likely to adhere to the treatment plan and feel motivated to work towards your goals.

To ""train"" your therapist, it's essential to communicate openly and actively with them. Here are some tips:

1. Be honest: Share your concerns, goals, and expectations with your therapist. Provide feedback on their approach and any areas where you feel they could improve.
2. Set goals: Work with your therapist to establish clear and measurable treatment goals. Regularly review progress and adjust goals as needed.
3. Practice self-care: Encourage your therapist to prioritize self-care and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or exercise. This can help them maintain their energy and motivation to provide the best possible care.
4. Be an active participant: Take an active role in your treatment by asking questions, sharing insights, and engaging in discussions during sessions.
5. Seek additional support: If you're not satisfied with your therapist's approach, don't hesitate to seek additional support from other mental health professionals.

Remember, finding the right therapist is a personal and ongoing process. Be patient, persistent, and open to change as needed to achieve the best possible results.",54.47080087661743

   What can I do? 

 ### Response: 

It's not uncommon for young children to have a strong attachment to their primary caregivers, especially in the mornings when they are awake and alert. It's possible that your three-year-old is feeling insecure or separated from you in the mornings, and the screaming for his parents is a way of expressing those feelings. Here are a few strategies you could try to help your child feel more secure and comfortable with you in the mornings:

1. Establish a consistent morning routine: Children thrive on routine, so try to establish a consistent morning routine that includes activities that your child enjoys, such as reading a book, singing a song, or playing a game. This can help your child feel more secure and comfortable with you in the mornings.
2. Offer choices and involve your child in decision-making: Giving your child choices and involving them in decision-making can help them feel more in control and secure. For example, you could ask your child if they want to wear a certain outfit or if they want to have breakfast in their room or in the kitchen.
3. Use positive reinforcement: Praise your child for their efforts and accomplishments, no matter how small. This can help build their confidence and make them feel more secure in your presence.
4. Be patient and understanding: It's important to be patient and understanding when dealing with a child's emotions. Avoid getting frustrated or upset when your child screams for their parents in the mornings, and instead try to offer comfort and reassurance.
5. Consider a gradual transition: If your child is very attached to their parents, it may be helpful to gradually transition them to your care in the mornings. For example, you could start by taking them to the kitchen for breakfast, then gradually increase the amount of time you spend with them before their parents arrive.
6. Talk to your child's parents: It's important to communicate with your child's parents about their behavior in the mornings. They may be able to offer additional insights or suggestions for how to help your child feel more secure with you.
7. Seek professional help: If your child's behavior persists and is causing significant distress, it may be helpful to seek professional help from a child psychologist or therapist. They can provide additional support and guidance on how to help your child feel more secure and comfortable with you.

Remember, it's important to be patient and understanding when dealing with a child's emotions. With time and consistency, you can help your child feel more secure and comfortable with you in the mornings.",39.36348056793213

It's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are resources available to help you work through these feelings and move forward in a positive direction.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize that what you experienced as a child is not your fault. Childhood sexual abuse is never the victim's fault, no matter how old you were or how much you may have resisted. It's important to remember that you were a child and did not have the capacity to give consent to these actions. It's also important to recognize that the person who committed these acts is responsible for their own actions, and they are not someone you need to blame or shame.

It's understandable that you may be feeling a range of emotions, including anger, guilt, shame, and confusion. It's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions and to give yourself time to process them. However, it's also important to recognize when it's time to seek help and support.

There are many resources available to help you cope with your past and move forward in a positive direction. One option is to seek out therapy or counseling with a trained mental health professional. This can provide you with a safe and supportive space to process your emotions and work through your experiences. You may also consider joining a support group for survivors of childhood sexual abuse. These groups can provide you with a sense of community and connection with others who have gone through similar experiences.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are also many self-care strategies that can help you cope with your feelings and move forward. These may include engaging in physical activity, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and taking steps to prioritize your mental health and well-being.

Remember, healing from childhood sexual abuse is a process that takes time and patience. It's important to be kind to yourself and to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle. There are many resources available to help you work through your feelings and move forward in a positive direction.

If you are interested in seeking help or support, there are many organizations that can provide you with information and resources.

It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with.

It can also be helpful to try and find healthy ways to express and release your anger. This might be through exercise, like running or yoga, or through creative activities like writing, painting, or music. Sometimes just talking to someone or writing down your feelings can help you process and release your anger in a healthy way.

I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal. 

 ### Response:  It's understandable that you're concerned about your daughter's well-being, especially if she's experiencing excessive stress and emotional distress. However, it's important to recognize that stress and emotional responses are normal parts of life, especially during times of change or difficulty.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your daughter is a bright student and is doing well academically. It's possible that the stress she's experiencing is related to academic pressures or expectations, rather than anything inherently ""silly"" or unimportant. It's important to validate her feelings and concerns, rather than dismissing them as trivial.

Rather than seeking medical attention, there are other ways to support your daughter during this time. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your daughter about her feelings and concerns. Listen actively and without judgment, and offer support and encouragement.
2. Help your daughter identify the sources of her stress and find ways to manage them. This might involve setting boundaries, prioritizing tasks, or finding healthy ways to cope with stress, such as exercise, mindfulness, or creative activities.
3. Encourage your daughter to take breaks and engage in self-care activities, such as taking a walk, reading a book, or spending time with friends.
4. Consider seeking the support of a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can help your daughter develop coping strategies and provide a safe and supportive space to process her emotions.

Remember, it's important to be patient and understanding when dealing with your daughter's stress and emotional responses. Acknowledge her feelings and offer support, rather than dismissing them or seeking medical attention prematurely. With time, support, and self-care, your daughter can learn to manage her stress and emotions in a healthy and productive way.",29.06883692741394

First of all, let's talk about the bullying. It's not okay that you've been subjected to this kind of treatment for five years, and it's completely understandable that it's only now starting to sink in. Bullying can have a huge impact on a person's mental health, and it's important to seek help if you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope. There are resources available to help you deal with the aftermath of bullying, such as counseling and support groups.

Regarding your struggle to find a hobby that you enjoy without feeling bad about yourself, it's important to remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace.

It sounds like you're going through a difficult time right now. It's understandable that you're feeling upset and confused after having a close and intimate connection with someone, only to have them pull away and suggest being just friends. It can be hard to accept that someone you were interested in and enjoyed spending time with no longer wants to pursue that level of connection.

It's important to remember that it's okay to feel upset and to take time to process your emotions. It's normal to want someone back after they've been a part of your life, especially if you had a strong connection. However, it's important to respect the other person's boundaries and decisions, even if they don't align with what you want.

One thing you might consider is having an open and honest conversation with the person about how you're feeling. It's possible that they may be able to provide insight into their own feelings and reasons for wanting to be just friends. This can help you understand their perspective and may even give you a chance to reconnect in a different way.

It's understandable that you kept forgiving him, hoping that he would change and things would get better, but it's important to recognize when it's time to let go.

It's not uncommon for people to stay in toxic relationships out of love, loyalty, or fear of being alone. However, staying in a relationship that is unhealthy or abusive can lead to more harm in the long run. You deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and honesty in a relationship.

It takes a lot of courage to confront the reality of a toxic relationship and make the decision to leave. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself during this time. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support, and take time for self-reflection to process your emotions.

Remember, you are not alone in this experience. Many people have gone through similar situations and have come out stronger on the other side. Take time to focus on your own healing and growth, and know that you deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a healthy relationship.

If you're feeling up to it, consider talking to your ex about why you're breaking up and how his actions affected you. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about the relationship and its demise. However, remember that you don't owe him any explanations or justifications, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being above all else.

Take care of yourself and remember that you deserve better. You deserve to be treated with love, respect, and kindness in a relationship, and don't settle for anything less.",29.039162158966064
"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.","These are common challenges that involve setting healthy boundaries with family, as well as friends and co-workers.  Therapy can help you to define, establish and enforce boundaries between self and others by being assertive.  This involves determining what things make you uncomfortable and how to communicate that with assertive, not passive, not aggressive, actions and language.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore. 

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed and frustrated with your mother's constant calls about your niece. Caring for an abandoned child can be a significant responsibility, and it's reasonable to feel like you're being asked to carry the weight of your sister's mistakes. However, it's important to remember that your mother is likely doing this out of love and concern for your niece's well-being.

Rather than dismissing her concerns or avoiding her calls, try to have an open and honest conversation with your mother about how you're feeling. Let her know that you understand the situation is difficult, but that you need some space to focus on your own life and well-being. Offer to help find other solutions or resources that can support your niece, such as counseling or additional support from other family members or community organizations.

It's also important to consider your own emotional well-being in this situation. Caring for a child can be incredibly rewarding, but it can also be emotionally draining. Make sure you're taking time for yourself, engaging in self-care activities, and prioritizing your own mental health.

Remember that you can't control your sister's actions, but you can control how you respond to the situation. By being understanding, empathetic, and supportive of your mother and niece, you can help create a more positive and loving environment for everyone involved.",22.11713194847107

What you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"". You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult - treat her like one. Maybe then she'll act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a ""but..."" and then explain all the reasons why you can't tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because that's what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices - you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents' lives are focused around them (some more than others) and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldn't want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is ""the right thing"" but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking - the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words.

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you're concerned about your daughter's behavior and health, and you want to help her. However, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that your daughter's behavior might be a coping mechanism for deeper emotional issues. It's possible that she's struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, which can cause her to withdraw from social interactions and neglect her personal hygiene and appearance.

Instead of jumping to conclusions or trying to ""fix"" her, it's important to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with your daughter. Ask her how she's feeling and what she needs from you. Listen to her response without interrupting or offering unsolicited advice.

You might say something like, ""Hey, I've noticed that you've been spending a lot of time in your room lately and not wanting to hang out with me or anyone else. Is everything okay? Is there something bothering you that you want to talk about?""

By creating a safe and supportive space for your daughter to express herself, you may be able to help her open up about her feelings and work towards finding a solution together.

It's also important to respect your daughter's boundaries and not push her to do things she's not comfortable with. Encourage her to seek professional help, such as therapy or counseling, if she's willing. These resources can provide her with the tools and support she needs to manage her mental health and improve her overall well-being.

Remember, communication and understanding are key to helping your daughter work through her issues. Be patient, supportive, and non-judgmental, and try to approach this situation with empathy and compassion.",27.66911292076111

 ### Response: 

I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation. It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused and unsure of what to do after discovering that your fiancé cheated on you. It's important to remember that you deserve to be in a healthy and fulfilling relationship, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge the severity of the situation. Cheating is a serious betrayal of trust, and it can be challenging to repair the damage that's been done. However, it's not impossible to move forward and work towards healing and rebuilding your relationship.

Before making any decisions, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your fiancé. Allow him to explain himself and provide his perspective on the situation. Listen carefully to what he has to say, and pay attention to how he responds to your concerns. It's important to assess whether he's genuinely remorseful and willing to work towards rebuilding your relationship.

If your fiancé is willing to put in the effort to regain your trust and respect, there are several steps you can take to move forward. These include:

1. Establishing boundaries and expectations: It's important to set clear boundaries and expectations for your relationship moving forward. This can involve discussing what behaviors are and aren't acceptable, and establishing consequences for any future infractions.
2. Focusing on communication: Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important after a betrayal. Make sure to communicate openly and honestly with your fiancé, and be willing to listen to his perspective as well.
3. Seeking professional help: Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support as you work through this difficult situation. They can help you process your emotions and develop strategies for healing and moving forward.
4. Taking time for yourself: It's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this time. Take time for yourself, engage in self-care activities, and seek support from friends and family.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to stay in the relationship or move on is a personal one. It's important to take the time to carefully consider your feelings and priorities before making any decisions.

"I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is certainly a tough spot. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things. You may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues, or if you have ever heard him talk about it. That may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. For example, if he has been watching the news lately, transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. Has he had an opinion? This won't tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender, but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. To tell you the truth, the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. There is no right or wrong way, best or worst. If you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? That's perfect. Want to have a friend with you for support? Equally perfect. Whatever thing you need to do. And, of course, there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. Unfortunately, the response from your dad can't be predicted. Some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. This is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. If things get heated, you have someone in your corner. There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy, and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. You can also Google some stories about how others came out.I refer many people to the www.letsqueerthingsup.com blog. It is a popular blog written by a trans man that I know.

 ### Input: I have known I was always different. This year, in December, I found out that I never felt female. I did research and have identified myself as male but don't know how to tell my dad. 

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and accept something as personal as your gender identity. It's completely understandable that you might feel nervous or scared about telling your dad, especially since it's a sensitive and complex topic.

Firstly, I want to assure you that you are not alone in this journey. Many people have gone through similar experiences, and there are resources and support available to help you through this process. You can start by reaching out to organizations that specialize in gender identity and expression, such as GLAAD or the Trevor Project. These organizations offer confidential and free support, including hotlines, online chats, and in-person counseling.

It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. You can also consider reaching out to trusted friends, family members, or a mental health professional who is knowledgeable about gender identity. They can provide emotional support and help you develop a plan for how to tell your dad.

When it comes to telling your dad, it's important to approach the conversation with care and sensitivity. You might consider writing down your thoughts and feelings in a letter or an email, and then sharing it with him in a private setting. Be sure to choose a time and place where you both feel comfortable and won't be distracted or interrupted.

It's okay if you feel nervous or scared during the conversation. It's a big step to take, and it's normal to feel anxious about sharing something so personal. However, try to remember that you have the right to express yourself and your identity, and that your dad loves you and wants what's best for you.

Remember, the most important thing is to be true to yourself and to communicate your feelings in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you. Don't hesitate to reach out for support and resources as you navigate this process. You deserve to be respected and loved for who you are, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.",30.77400827407837

 ### Response: 🤔 That sounds like a big change! Have you been feeling unfulfilled in your current job, or is there something else that's causing you to want to make a change? It's important to take the time to reflect on your reasons for wanting to make a change, as it can have a big impact on your well-being and happiness in the long run. 

 Maybe you could try making a list of pros and cons of staying in your current job versus making a change. This can help you get a clearer picture of what's important to you and what you want to achieve. Additionally, you could try talking to a trusted friend or mentor about your feelings and get their perspective on the situation. They may be able to offer some valuable insights or suggestions. 

 It's also worth considering what you want to achieve by making a change. Is it just to get out of your current job, or is there something specific you want to accomplish?

Once you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, you can start thinking about how to make it happen.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable that you're feeling upset and betrayed after discovering that your ex-partner lied to you about another woman. Lying and breaking promises are major red flags in any relationship, and it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and safety.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you don't deserve to be lied to or cheated on. You deserve to be in a relationship where you're respected, valued, and treated with honesty and integrity. It's not uncommon for people to make mistakes or poor choices in relationships, but it's how we learn and grow from those mistakes that matters.

It's understandable that you may be feeling a range of emotions, including anger, hurt, and confusion. It's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions and to give yourself time to process them. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling, as they can offer emotional support and help you find healthy ways to cope with your feelings.

In terms of what you should do about the situation, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety. If you feel that you're in danger or at risk of harm, please seek help immediately. If you're in a situation where you're not in immediate danger but still feel unsafe or uncomfortable, consider reaching out to a crisis hotline or support service for help.

In terms of the relationship itself, it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs and boundaries. This may involve setting boundaries with your ex-partner or taking a break from the relationship to focus on your own healing and growth. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you're treated with respect and care, and don't be afraid to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

Remember that healing from a breakup takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be kind to yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being, and know that you don't have to go through this alone.",33.21937322616577

 ### Input: We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things? 

 ### Response: 

It's not uncommon for communication issues to arise in relationships, especially when one person has trouble accepting what the other person says. This can lead to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and a breakdown in communication. Here are some steps you can take to fix things:

1. Identify the issue: The first step is to identify the root cause of the problem. Are you feeling unheard or misunderstood? Are you feeling attacked or criticized? Once you understand the issue, you can start working on a solution.
2. Practice active listening: Active listening is a skill that can help you better understand the other person and communicate your own thoughts and feelings more effectively. This involves paying attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing what you've heard to ensure you understand.
3. Use ""I"" statements: When expressing your feelings or concerns, try using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. This can help prevent defensiveness and promote a more constructive conversation. For example, instead of saying ""You never listen to me,"" say ""I feel unheard when I share my thoughts and feelings and don't get the response I want.""
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume you know what the other person is thinking or feeling. Instead, ask open-ended questions to gain a better understanding of their perspective. This can help prevent misunderstandings and promote a more empathetic and respectful conversation.
5. Take a break if necessary: If the conversation is becoming too heated or emotional, it may be helpful to take a break and revisit the issue when both parties are feeling calmer. This can help prevent escalation and promote a more productive conversation.
6. Seek outside help: If the communication issues persist and are causing significant problems in your relationship, consider seeking outside help from a therapist or counselor.

Dear friend, 

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your struggles with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these kinds of feelings, and I want you to know that you are not alone. Many people struggle with similar issues, and it's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. 

First of all, I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable to feel like you've lost your friends and that you're struggling with your sleeping patterns. It's normal to feel disconnected from others and to experience changes in your mood and behavior, especially during times of stress or transition. It's important to remember that these feelings are temporary and can change with time and support. 

Regarding your desire to cut yourself, I want to acknowledge that this is a very difficult topic to discuss, and I want to assure you that I'm here to listen and support you without judgment. It's important to understand that self-harm is not a solution to your feelings, and it can lead to more harm in the long run. I encourage you to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can work with you to develop healthier coping mechanisms. 

It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel depressed and to listen to sad music. It's normal to experience a range of emotions, and it's important to allow yourself to feel and process these emotions in a healthy way. However, if these feelings are becoming overwhelming or are interfering with your daily life, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional. 

Remember that you don't have to fake a smile or put on a brave face. It's okay to be vulnerable and to ask for help when you need it. You are not alone, and there are many resources available to support you. 

Please consider reaching out to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or school counselor, about how you're feeling. They can provide you with emotional support and help you find resources to support you. You can also reach out to a crisis hotline or text line, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) or the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741). These resources are available 24/7 and can provide you with immediate support. 

Remember that you are not alone, and there are many people who care about you and want to help. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]",42.22281241416931

My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay. 

 ### Response: 

It's understandable that you want to help your girlfriend during this difficult time. Quitting drinking can be challenging, and it's common for people to experience emotional changes, including depression, as they adjust to life without alcohol. Here are some suggestions on how you can support her:

1. Listen and validate her feelings: It's essential to create a safe and non-judgmental space where your girlfriend feels comfortable expressing her emotions. Listen to her without interrupting or offering unsolicited advice. Validate her feelings, and let her know that you're there to support her.
2. Encourage professional help: Depression is a treatable condition, and seeking professional help can make a significant difference. Encourage your girlfriend to consult with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. These professionals can provide her with the tools and resources she needs to manage her depression.
3. Support her in small ways: Small gestures can go a long way in helping your girlfriend feel supported and cared for. Offer to cook her favorite meal, run errands for her, or simply be there to listen. These small acts of kindness can help her feel more connected and less alone.
4. Be patient and understanding: Recovery from alcohol addiction and depression can take time, and it's important to be patient and understanding. Avoid putting pressure on your girlfriend to ""snap out of it"" or ""get over it quickly."" Instead, offer ongoing support and encouragement as she works through her challenges.
5. Take care of yourself too: Supporting a loved one through a difficult time can be emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of yourself as well, by prioritizing self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends and family.
6. Encourage self-care practices: Encourage your girlfriend to engage in self-care activities that bring her joy and relaxation. This can include yoga, reading, or taking a relaxing bath. Self-care practices can help her manage stress and anxiety, which can be triggers for depression.
7. Plan fun activities together: Plan fun activities that your girlfriend enjoys, such as going for a walk, watching a movie, or engaging in a hobby together. These activities can help take her mind off her depression and provide a sense of enjoyment and connection.
8. Be aware of triggers: Be aware of potential triggers, such as social situations or stressful events, and help your girlfriend develop strategies to manage them. Encourage her to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist when needed.
9. Offer ongoing support: Recovery from alcohol addiction and depression is a long-term process, and ongoing support is crucial. Let your girlfriend know that you're there for her, no matter what, and offer your support in the coming weeks and months.
10. Seek professional help for yourself too: If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to support your girlfriend, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with guidance and support to help you navigate this challenging situation.

Remember, supporting a loved one through a difficult time requires patience, empathy, and ongoing support. By following these suggestions, you can help your girlfriend feel more connected, less alone, and on the path to recovery.",52.312732219696045

5. Try mindfulness techniques: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you stay present and focused, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts about the weather.
6. Find activities you enjoy: Engage in activities that bring you joy and make you feel good, whether it's reading, painting, or playing music.
7. Seek professional help: If your symptoms of SAD are severe or persistent, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with additional coping strategies and support.

In my book, the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adults. Of course the girls should be told, because they have the right to know. Their voice is not the only one I'm concerned about here though. I believe your husband has the right to insist that his daughters be in a safe home, and there is clear evidence this man is not safe. This woman is putting her own comfort (she simply doesn't want to deal with her partner's situation, her own fears, or anyone else's needs) above the safety of two vulnerable girls. Honestly, if it was me, my kids wouldn't be even visiting that home with that man present, ""repented"" or not. It's not worth the risk.

 ### Response: 

It is completely understandable that you are feeling a tremendous amount of stress and concern for your step-daughters' well-being, given the information you have provided. The fact that your husband's ex-wife has kept this information from your step-daughters and has downplayed the severity of her husband's addiction is unacceptable and could potentially put the girls in harm's way.

It is important to recognize that child pornography is a serious crime, and an addiction to it can have severe consequences for the individuals involved, particularly children. The fact that your step-father has admitted to his addiction and is seeking help is a positive step, but it does not change the fact that he has engaged in illegal and harmful behavior.

As a concerned family member, it is important that you advocate for the safety and well-being of your step-daughters. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your husband's ex-wife about your concerns and to express your desire to ensure that the girls are protected from any potential harm. It may also be helpful to seek the advice of a mental health professional or a legal expert who can provide guidance on how to handle this situation.

It is important to remember that the safety and well-being of children should always be the top priority, and it is important to take any necessary steps to protect them from harm.

In terms of how to handle the situation with your step-daughters, it may be helpful to have a conversation with them in a safe and supportive environment, where they can feel comfortable and confident in sharing their feelings and concerns. It may also be helpful to provide them with information and resources that can help them understand the nature of child pornography and the potential dangers associated with it.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to ensure that your step-daughters are safe and protected from any potential harm, and to provide them with the support and resources they need to lead happy and healthy lives.",29.927629470825195

   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts? 

 ### Response: 

It's completely normal to have random thoughts that we don't want, and it's important to recognize that these thoughts are not a reflection of your worth as a person. These thoughts are often the result of negative self-talk, which can be triggered by various factors such as past experiences, societal messages, or even biological changes in the brain.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that these thoughts are not your own, and they don't define your worth as a person. They are just thoughts, and they don't have any real power over you unless you give them permission to do so. By recognizing that these thoughts are not yours, you can start to challenge their validity and work towards replacing them with more positive and realistic thoughts.

Here are some strategies that may help you stop having these thoughts:

1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, and try to reframe these negative thoughts as mere thoughts rather than facts. Remind yourself that you are worthy of love and respect, regardless of any negative thoughts that may come up.
2. Challenge the thoughts: Ask yourself if there is any evidence to support these thoughts, or if they are simply based on assumptions or biases. When you challenge these thoughts, you can start to see them for what they are – just thoughts – and not necessarily reflective of your worth.
3. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, and can help you develop a more neutral or positive attitude towards them. When you notice these negative thoughts, try to observe them without judgment, and focus on the present moment instead.
4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about these thoughts, and seek their support and guidance. Sharing your experiences with someone you trust can help you feel less alone, and can provide you with a different perspective on how to manage these thoughts.
5. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as exercise, meditation, or creative pursuits. When you feel good about yourself, you are less likely to be swayed by negative thoughts.

Remember, it's okay to have negative thoughts from time to time, and it's important to be kind and compassionate towards yourself as you work through them. With time and practice, you can learn to manage these thoughts and develop a more positive and realistic outlook on yourself and your worth.",37.34523916244507

 ### Response: 

I'm so sorry to hear that you've gone through such a traumatic experience. It's completely understandable that you're struggling to feel emotions after something like that. It's important to remember that healing is a process, and it can take time for emotions to return. However, there are some things you can try to help yourself feel more emotionally grounded and present:

1. Seek professional help: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and PTSD. They can provide you with a safe and supportive space to process your emotions and work through your experiences.
2. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional needs by getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Exercise, meditation, and yoga can also be helpful in managing stress and anxiety.
3. Connect with others: Reach out to loved ones, friends, or support groups for help and connection. Sharing your experiences with others who understand can be incredibly validating and healing.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this feeling, and there are many resources available to help you work through these feelings. 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with feelings of disconnection from themselves and their thoughts, and it's not uncommon for this to happen after a traumatic event or a period of high stress. It's important to remember that you're not broken or flawed, and that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth as a person.

"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex.

Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.
   Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking.

It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","Hi Winters, I'm so glad you wrote, because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). This current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness.  I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there.

 ### Response: 

Dear [Name],

Thank you for sharing your struggles with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these kinds of feelings, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like virginity and relationships. It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this.

First of all, let's talk about the pressure to lose your virginity. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you see your peers around you in relationships. But it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and there's no rush to do something that you're not ready for. It's okay to take your time and wait for someone who truly cares about you and wants to be with you in a meaningful way.

It's also important to remember that your worth and identity go beyond your sexual experience. You're more than just a virgin or a non-virgin, and you have so much to offer the world. Don't let society's expectations define your self-worth.

I understand that you may feel pressured to hook up with people on social media sites, but I want to encourage you to be careful with these kinds of situations. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety, especially when it comes to sexual encounters. It's okay to say no to things that don't feel right for you, and it's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations with any potential partners.

It's also worth considering the reasons why you feel pressured to be in a relationship. Is it because you truly want to be in a relationship, or is it because you feel like you need to fit in with your peers? Take some time to reflect on your feelings and priorities, and don't be afraid to reach out for support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need it.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself about your virginity. It's a personal choice, and there's no one-size-fits-all timeline for when someone should lose their virginity. It's okay to take your time and wait for someone who truly cares about you.

Remember, you deserve to be with someone who respects and values you for who you are, and you don't need to rush into anything that doesn't feel right for you. Take care of yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it.

Sending you lots of love and support,
[Your Name]",39.76853799819946
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Absolutely! Therapy is the best time to have the opportunity
to open up and deal with the range of emotions that may be bothering you.
Therapy is a “safe space” to take time out of your normal daily life and
cope with the emotions that are hiding underneath. If, for some reason, you are
not comfortable in therapy, you should address this concern with your therapist
or find someone whom you feel more comfortable opening up with and express
yourself comfortably.","### Instructions: Respond accordingly to the input with a maximum length of 1024 words. 

 ### Input: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me? 

 ### Response: 

It is completely normal for people to cry during therapy sessions. In fact, it is a common occurrence. Therapy is a safe space where individuals can express their emotions and work through challenging experiences, and it is normal for emotions to surface during these sessions. Crying can be a healthy and therapeutic response to processing and dealing with difficult emotions and experiences.

There are several reasons why people may cry during therapy:

1. Emotional release: Tears can be a way for individuals to release pent-up emotions and tensions. During therapy, people may feel safe enough to express their emotions and work through them in a healthy way.
2. Empathy and connection: When a therapist shows empathy and understanding, it can create a sense of connection and safety. This can lead to feelings of comfort and relaxation, which can result in tears.
3. Catharsis: Therapy can be a cathartic experience, allowing individuals to confront and work through difficult emotions and experiences. Tears can be a natural response to this process.
4. Self-expression: Tears can be a way for individuals to express themselves and communicate their feelings to their therapist. This can help the therapist understand the individual's emotional experience and provide more effective support.

It's important to remember that crying during therapy is not a sign of weakness or vulnerability. It's a normal and healthy response to the therapeutic process. In fact, research has shown that emotional expression and release can have positive effects on mental health, such as reducing stress and improving mood.

If you're concerned about crying during therapy, it's important to communicate this with your therapist. They can work with you to create a safe and comfortable environment where you feel supported and able to express yourself freely.

In summary, it's completely normal for people to cry during therapy sessions. It's a healthy and therapeutic response to the process, and it can lead to positive effects on mental health. If you're concerned about crying during therapy, communicate with your therapist and work together to create a comfortable and supportive environment.",33.26776576042175

 ### Response: 

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you have a legitimate and valid interest in women's clothing, and that it's not uncommon for people to have fetishes or kinky interests. However, it's also important to consider the potential implications and consequences of acting on these desires, particularly in a society that often stigmatizes or judges people for their sexual preferences.

As a heterosexual male in your late 20s, it's important to recognize that wearing women's clothing in private can be a complex and sensitive issue, as it can intersect with societal expectations and norms around gender roles and expression. While it's important to respect your own desires and boundaries, it's also important to be mindful of how your actions may impact others, including potential romantic partners or friends.

One way to approach this issue is to consider the reasons behind your desire to wear women's clothing. Are you doing it for the pleasure and enjoyment of it, or are you feeling pressured or compelled to do so? Are there any underlying issues or emotions that may be contributing to this desire? Exploring these questions can help you better understand your own motivations and desires, and can also help you navigate the complexities of this issue.

It's also important to consider the potential risks and consequences of acting on this desire. While it's important to respect your own desires and boundaries, it's also important to be mindful of how your actions may impact others, including potential romantic partners or friends. Wearing women's clothing in private can be a sensitive issue, and it's important to be considerate of others' feelings and boundaries.

In terms of how to navigate this issue, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional or a trusted friend or partner. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your desires and boundaries, and can also offer support and guidance as you navigate this complex issue.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that you have the right to respect and explore your own desires and boundaries, while also being mindful of how your actions may impact others. By being considerate of others' feelings and boundaries, and by taking the time to understand and explore your own motivations and desires, you can work towards a more informed and empowered understanding of this issue.",35.83515644073486

 ### Response:  It's completely understandable to be concerned about your daughter's well-being, especially if she's experiencing excessive stress and emotional distress. It's important to address this issue as soon as possible to prevent it from negatively impacting her mental health and overall quality of life.

However, if your daughter's stress is impacting her daily life and causing persistent emotional distress, it may be a sign of an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.

Here are some steps you can take to support your daughter:

1. Have an open and non-judgmental conversation: Talk to your daughter about how she's feeling and listen to her concerns without interrupting or judging. Encourage her to express her feelings and thoughts, and validate her emotions.
2. Encourage self-care: Help your daughter identify healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, meditation, or creative activities, that can help her manage stress and anxiety. Encourage her to take breaks and engage in activities that bring her joy and relaxation.

 ### Response: 

Thank you for sharing this difficult situation with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit to cheating on one's partner, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I must advise you that cheating is never the solution to any problem, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.

It's important to understand that cheating can cause significant harm to your partner and your relationship. It can lead to feelings of betrayal, mistrust, and resentment, which can be difficult to overcome. Moreover, it can also lead to a breakdown in communication and intimacy, which can make it challenging to work through any issues that may arise in the future.

Instead of resorting to cheating, I suggest you have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns. It may be uncomfortable, but it's better to address the issues head-on rather than hiding behind lies and secrets. It's important to be honest about your actions and to listen to your husband's perspective as well.

Additionally, it may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor who can provide you with guidance and support in navigating this difficult situation. They can help you identify the underlying issues that may be contributing to your behavior and work with you to develop healthier coping strategies.

Remember, honesty and communication are key to building and maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship. It may take time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run to work through this difficult situation and to build a stronger, more trusting relationship with your partner.",24.14185929298401

 ### Input: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me? 

 ### Response: 

It is completely normal for people to cry during therapy. In fact, research suggests that emotional expression, including crying, is an important part of the therapeutic process. Therapy provides a safe and supportive environment for individuals to process and express their emotions, and it is common for people to experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and relief, during sessions.

Crying during therapy can serve several purposes. Firstly, it can be a way to release and process pent-up emotions, which can help individuals feel a sense of relief and calm. Secondly, it can be a way to communicate and express feelings that may be difficult to articulate through words alone. Finally, crying during therapy can be a sign of emotional release and growth, as it can indicate that an individual is confronting and processing difficult emotions and experiences.

It's important to note that crying during therapy is not a sign of weakness or failure. It's a normal and necessary part of the therapeutic process, and it's not uncommon for people to experience emotional releases during sessions. In fact, many therapists actively encourage and support emotional expression during therapy, as it can be an important step towards healing and growth.

If you're concerned about crying during therapy, it may be helpful to talk to your therapist about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance on how to navigate emotional expression during sessions, and can help you feel more comfortable and secure in the therapeutic environment. Remember, therapy is a safe and supportive space for emotional expression and growth, and it's okay to be vulnerable and open during sessions.",25.672396898269653

The period of adolescence and emerging adulthood are tumultuous times for youth ( and their parents). The pressure to fit-in, be liked, and succeed could be some of the contributing factors for your daughter's stress. I  have had many adolescent clients who do very well academically, but keep it well hidden from their peers so that they can fit in.

 ### Response: 

It's completely understandable to be concerned about your daughter's well-being, especially if she's experiencing stress and anxiety about something as seemingly trivial as school. However, it's important to remember that stress and anxiety can have a significant impact on a person's mental health, and it's not uncommon for students to feel overwhelmed or stressed during their academic years.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your daughter is a bright student and has a 4.0 GPA, which is a significant accomplishment. It's possible that the pressure to maintain this level of academic performance may be contributing to her stress and anxiety. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with her about the sources of her stress and how it's affecting her.

One approach you could take is to encourage your daughter to express her feelings and concerns to you or another trusted adult, such as a teacher or school counselor. Sometimes, just talking about how she's feeling can help her feel better and gain a new perspective on the situation. Additionally, you could suggest that she engage in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage her stress and anxiety.

It's also important to consider the potential underlying causes of your daughter's stress and anxiety. For example, is she feeling overwhelmed by the amount of homework or studying she's expected to do? Is she feeling pressure from peers or teachers to perform well? Identifying the root causes of her stress can help you and your daughter develop strategies to address them.

While it's understandable that you might be concerned about your daughter's stress and anxiety, it's important to avoid labeling her as ""stressed out"" or ""anxious"" too quickly. Instead, focus on providing a supportive and non-judgmental environment where she feels comfortable expressing her feelings and concerns.

In terms of seeking professional help, it's important to consult with a mental health professional who specializes in working with children and adolescents. They can provide your daughter with the tools and strategies she needs to manage her stress and anxiety, as well as offer support and guidance to you and your family.

In conclusion, it's important to take your daughter's stress and anxiety seriously and to offer her the support and guidance she needs to manage her emotions and perform well in school. By having open and honest conversations with her, identifying the underlying causes of her stress, and seeking professional help when necessary, you can help your daughter feel better and succeed academically.",39.37146282196045
