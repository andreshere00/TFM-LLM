It's important to remember that it's okay to take time to process your feelings and work through this challenging situation.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel sad, confused, and lost after a breakup, especially when it's not what you wanted or expected. Allow yourself to feel these emotions and don't try to suppress them. Instead, try to channel them into something productive, like writing, drawing, or exercise.
Next, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, try to stay grounded in the present. Practice mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay present and centered.
It's also important to take care of yourself during this time. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Exercise, yoga, or spending time in nature can be great ways to boost your mood and reduce stress.
Another helpful strategy is to practice self-compassion. Be kind and understanding towards yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over your feelings. Remember that it's okay to feel hurt and that it's normal to take time to heal.
Finally, try to focus on the positive aspects of your life. Think about the things that bring you joy, whether it's spending time with friends and family, pursuing a hobby, or setting new goals for yourself. Focusing on the positive can help shift your perspective and make it easier to move on.
Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the space to heal and grow.

"Hello. Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. That first session is often very low key. There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. It's true. We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. What makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. Counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. Coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together. Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. We honestly do not, plain and simple. Counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. Yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. Very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. So as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy. </s>","great that you're considering seeking professional help for your mental health. Starting the counseling process can seem daunting, but it's important to remember that it's a brave and important step towards taking care of yourself. Here are some steps you can take to start the counseling process:
1. Find a therapist: Research therapists in your area and find one who specializes in the area you need help with (e.g. anxiety, depression, relationships, etc.). You can ask for recommendations from your doctor, friends, or family members. You can also search online directories or professional organizations like the American Psychological Association (APA) or the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
2. Check your insurance: Find out if your insurance covers therapy sessions and if so, what the coverage entails. Some insurance plans may have a list of in-network therapists, while others may require you to pay out-of-pocket and then seek reimbursement.
3. Schedule a consultation: Once you've found a therapist, schedule a consultation or intake session. This is usually a free session where you can get to know the therapist, discuss your concerns, and determine if it's a good fit.
4. Be honest and open: During the consultation, be honest and open about your concerns and reasons for seeking therapy. The therapist is there to listen and help, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts and feelings.
5. Set goals and expectations: Work with your therapist to set goals and expectations for your therapy sessions. This will help you stay motivated and engaged in the process.
Remember, starting the counseling process takes courage and vulnerability. Be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to reach out for help. With the right support and guidance, you can achieve your mental health goals and live a happier, healthier life.

8. Take a break: If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to move forward, consider taking a break from the relationship. This can give you both some space and time to think about what you want and how you can move forward in a healthy way.
9. Seek professional help: If you're finding it difficult to cope with the situation on your own, consider seeking the help of a professional. A therapist or counselor can provide you with support and guidance on how to deal with the situation and move forward in a healthy way.
10. Remember that you're not alone: It's important to remember that you're not alone in this situation. Many people have been in a similar situation, and there are resources available to help you cope. Don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it.

"Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" You might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict. I don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation.  One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support. Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger. I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness. </s>"," completely normal to feel guilty or ashamed after a night of drinking, especially if you have acted in ways that you regret while under the influence. It is important to recognize that these feelings are not a sign of a problem, but rather a sign that you are taking responsibility for your actions and are working to make positive changes in your life.
Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that alcohol can affect your behavior and decision-making, leading you to do things that you might not normally do when sober. This does not mean that you are a bad person or that you have a problem, but rather that alcohol can impair your judgment and behavior.
It is also common for people to feel anxious or guilty after a night of drinking, especially if they have acted in ways that they regret. This can be a sign that you are taking responsibility for your actions and are working to make positive changes in your life.
If you find that you are consistently feeling guilty or ashamed after a night of drinking, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your feelings and work with you to develop strategies for managing them in a healthy and constructive way.
In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your feelings of guilt and shame after a night of drinking:
1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding with yourself, and try not to be too hard on yourself. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it is okay to have regrets.
2. Take responsibility for your actions: If you have acted in ways that you regret, try to take responsibility for your actions and apologize to those affected. This can help you feel more in control and can also help to repair any damage that may have been done.
3. Set boundaries: Try to set boundaries for yourself when it comes to drinking, such as limiting the amount you drink or avoiding situations where you know you will be tempted to drink too much.
4. Seek support: Talk to friends and family members about your feelings, and seek their support and encouragement. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who understands what you are going through.

In conclusion, it is important to recognize that feeling guilty or ashamed after a night of drinking is a normal and natural response. It is not a sign of a problem, but rather a sign that you are taking responsibility for your actions and are working to make positive changes in your life. If you find that these feelings are persistent and are interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor.

"Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself. </s>"," thank you for sharing your struggles with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling with something, and I'm here to listen and offer support. It's completely understandable to feel upset or angry when someone is spreading rumors or saying negative things about you or your relationship. No one deserves to be treated with disrespect or cruelty, and it's important to stand up for yourself and your loved ones.
However, I want to encourage you to think about how you're dealing with these situations. Lashing out at the person who's causing the drama or at your boyfriend may not be the most effective way to handle the situation. It's important to find healthy ways to manage your emotions and communicate your feelings in a constructive way.
Here are a few suggestions that may help:
1. Take a step back: When you feel yourself getting upset or angry, take a deep breath and step back from the situation. Give yourself a moment to calm down before reacting.
2. Use ""I"" statements: When you do speak up, try using ""I"" statements to express your feelings. For example, ""I feel upset when you say things about me. Can we find a way to resolve this?"" This can help the other person understand your perspective and feel less defensive.
3. Practice empathy: Try to see things from the other person's point of view. Why do you think they might be spreading rumors or saying negative things about you? Is there something going on in their life that's causing them to act this way?
4. Communicate with your boyfriend: It's important to communicate with your partner about how their behavior is affecting you. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and work together to find a solution.
Remember, it's okay to feel upset or angry when someone is treating you with disrespect. But it's important to handle the situation in a way that doesn't hurt the people you love. With time and practice, you can learn to manage your emotions and communicate effectively in difficult situations.
Keep in mind that it's okay to ask for help along the way. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member about your struggles. They may be able to offer additional support and guidance.

"Not liking someone is not cruel - even if it is a family member. There is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister. Some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well, other don't. We all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone - even if they are related. In fact, sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each other's flaws and imperfections. With that being said - it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister. Sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect, and sometimes actually liking each other. </s>","completely normal to have feelings of disconnection or estrangement towards a family member, especially during the teenage years.

It's understandable that you may feel conflicted about your feelings towards your sister, and it can be helpful to talk to someone about how you're feeling. A trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to express your feelings and work through them.
It's important to remember that you don't have to be friends with someone just because they are your sibling. It's okay to have your own boundaries and to prioritize your own feelings and needs.

This can help you both to understand each other's feelings and to find a way to move forward in a positive way.

First of all, it's important to acknowledge that your anger is not something to be ashamed of. It's a common emotion that can arise in any situation, and it doesn't define who you are as a person. However, it's important to learn how to manage your anger in a way that doesn't negatively impact those around you.
One strategy you can try is deep breathing exercises. When you feel yourself getting angry, take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm you down and give you a moment to think before reacting.
Another strategy is to identify your triggers. What are the things that make you feel angry? Is it something your partner does? Is it a particular situation? Once you identify your triggers, you can work on finding ways to avoid or cope with them.
It's also important to communicate with your partner about your anger issues. They may not realize how their behavior is affecting you, and talking about it can help them understand your perspective and find ways to support you.
Finally, consider seeking professional help. A therapist can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your anger and develop strategies for managing it in a healthier way.
Remember, managing anger is a process that takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it. With time and effort, you can learn to manage your anger in a way that benefits you and those around you.

However, it's important to approach the conversation in a way that feels comfortable and safe for you. You could start by expressing how you're feeling, and why. For example, you could say something like, ""Hey Mom and Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately.

"Hi, San Diego. I'm sad that this was your first experience (in 25 years) with feeling in love. You deserve better.

In my humble opinion, much heartache and many poor relationships come from attaching too soon. It takes years to get to know someone deeply. I know it's hard to keep yourself from falling in love, but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly, because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happens.If I was your therapist, I'd be curious about how this is the first time you've fallen in love? Or is it that you were in love 25 years ago?  Was your heart broken then, or did something encourage your heart to close? What has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now? Is there a danger that you will decide love isn't worth the risk?

"Yes, counseling can help people.How this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding.Also, a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someone's strong emotions overwhelm them.This is different than in everyday circumstances.  When someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone else's feelings, there is no one who asks reflective questions.Last, people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected. </s>","completely normal to have doubts and questions about the effectiveness of counseling, especially if you've never experienced it before.

"Hi there, Thank you for your openness about the challenge you are experiencing in your relationship. Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people's life, but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple. The first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband. It's important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example, asking your husband how often does he want to have sex/ week or /month. When having this conversation, it's important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem, yet. There are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic/friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page - lack of sex might not be a problem. If there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire, I would recommend seeing a professional relationship & sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic, what's creating it, what's getting in a way of connecting sexually and to assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions. </s>","completely normal and understandable that you're feeling frustrated and concerned about the lack of intimacy in your relationship. It's important to remember that every couple is different and has their own unique rhythm and needs when it comes to sex and intimacy.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that a low sex drive or a lack of connection in the bedroom is not uncommon, and it doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything wrong with either of you. Life can get busy, and priorities can shift, which can lead to a decrease in the frequency of sex. Additionally, many factors such as stress, health issues, or simply not feeling connected can also affect libido and intimacy.
It's great that you're looking to improve your connection with your husband and work on building a stronger, more fulfilling relationship. Here are some suggestions that may help:
1. Communicate openly and honestly: It's important to talk to your husband about how you're feeling and what you need from him. Be honest and open about your desires and feelings, and listen to his perspective as well. Try to use ""I"" statements instead of blaming or accusing language, which can create distance and defensiveness.
2. Prioritize quality over quantity: Instead of focusing solely on the frequency of sex, consider prioritizing the quality of your connections. Take the time to connect with each other on an emotional and intellectual level, and find ways to show affection and appreciation outside of the bedroom.
3. Explore new ways of connecting: There are many ways to connect with your partner beyond sex, such as cuddling, massages, or simply spending time together doing things you both enjoy. Experiment with different activities and find what works best for you both.
4. Seek professional help: If you're struggling to connect with each other or if you're experiencing ongoing stress or tension in your relationship, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for you both to work through any issues and improve your communication and connection.
Remember, improving your connection with your partner takes time, effort, and patience. Be kind to yourselves and each other, and keep working towards building a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.

I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
 Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC </s>","completely normal to feel worthless at times, and it's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling.

"You're right that long-distance relationships can be complicated. If he loves you and you love him, that's a great start. I wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved, valued, special, and appreciated.When having important discussions, consider the following:Make sure it is a good time to have a discussion (and if you're doing it in writing because of the distance, you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesn't have 10 minutes or something like that)Try to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other. Asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversations.When having discussions face-to-face, I often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them. As for how that translates to distance, maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the Internet (or, if possible, use some kind of timeframe).Consider what questions you would like answers to. For example, are you wondering:What should I do if I miss you or want to talk to you more? I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I also don't want to hide my feelings. Can I share them with you?If you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly, can I keep sending you messages or is that overwhelming?How will you ask for support from me?Some couples really want to protect each other. In doing so, instead of hiding our emotions, can we share them and work through them together?Whatever else comes to mind.Gary Chapman is famous for his books about the 5 Love Languages.

It's common for people to grow apart, especially as they go through different stages of life. However, it's important to remember that communication and effort can help you reconnect and strengthen your relationship. Here are some things you can try:
1. Have an open and honest conversation: Sit down with your husband and have a calm, respectful conversation about how you're feeling. Be specific about the things that are making you feel disconnected and uncared for. Try to use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, you could say, ""I feel like we've grown apart in the past few years, and I'm feeling really lonely and unsupported. I want us to work on reconnecting and feeling closer again.""
2. Identify common interests: Take some time to think about what you and your husband used to enjoy doing together, and see if there are any activities you can do together again. This can help you reconnect and create new memories together. You could try taking a class, going on a weekend trip, or simply spending time together doing something you both enjoy.
3. Make time for each other: With busy schedules, it can be easy to let quality time with your partner fall by the wayside. Make a conscious effort to set aside time each week to spend together, whether it's a date night or just a quiet evening at home. This can help you feel more connected and strengthen your relationship.
4. Practice empathy and active listening: Sometimes, when we feel disconnected from our partner, it's because we're not really listening to each other or understanding each other's perspectives. Practice active listening and empathy by really paying attention to what your husband is saying, and trying to see things from his point of view. This can help you feel more connected and understanding of each other.
5. Seek outside help: If you've tried these things and still feel disconnected from your husband, it may be helpful to seek outside help. Consider couples therapy, which can provide a safe and supportive environment to work through your issues and improve your communication and connection.

As a  Parent it can be very hard to see your child struggling. It sounds like they’re experiencing anxiety from their stress. It’s always a good idea to check in with your family doctor. Many children are experiencing anxiety and can benefit from individual counseling services to help them cope with their stress. School pressures and academic achievements  can you create physical stress responses in the body. Seeing a counselor can also help you as the mom or dad have available tools to provide Continued support. It sounds like you are a great support for them and helping them connect to their resources. </s>,"completely understandable to be concerned about your daughter's well-being, especially if she's experiencing excessive stress and emotional distress. It's important to recognize that it's normal for children and teenagers to feel stressed and overwhelmed at times, especially during the school year. However, if her stress is impacting her daily life and causing her to feel persistently unhappy, anxious, or depressed, it may be helpful to seek professional support.
Here are some things you can consider:
1. Have an open and honest conversation with your daughter: Ask her how she's feeling and what's causing her stress. Listen attentively to her response and offer your support. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns, and validate her emotions.
2. Encourage self-care practices: Suggest activities that can help her relax and manage stress, such as deep breathing exercises, yoga, or reading a book.
3. Seek professional help: Consult with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide your daughter with the tools and support she needs to manage her stress and emotions.
4. Consider a referral to a psychologist: If you feel that your daughter's stress is impacting her daily life and causing significant distress, it may be helpful to consult with a psychologist. A psychologist can assess your daughter's mental health and provide evidence-based interventions to help her manage her stress and emotions.
5. Take care of yourself too: As a parent, it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. Make sure to take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed.

Remember, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Avoid blaming or criticizing your daughter for feeling stressed, as this can exacerbate the situation.

"Counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation.  For some, this process can take a very long, winding path of self-discovery, while, for others, they are seeking a purposeful, solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. It's important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. I often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals. On a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours.  However, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication. </s>","completely normal to have doubts and questions about the effectiveness of counseling, especially if you've never experienced it before. However, research has consistently shown that counseling can be a highly effective form of therapy for a wide range of mental health issues. Here are some reasons why:
1. A safe space to process emotions: Counseling provides a confidential and non-judgmental space for you to express your feelings and emotions. This can be incredibly helpful in allowing you to process and work through difficult emotions and experiences.
2. Developing self-awareness: Through counseling, you can gain a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This increased self-awareness can help you identify patterns and habits that may be contributing to your mental health issues, and work on making positive changes.
3. Learning coping skills: Counseling can teach you various coping skills and strategies to help you manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues. These skills can be applied in your daily life to help you feel more in control and resilient.
4. Improved relationships: Counseling can help you develop healthier communication and relationship skills, which can lead to improved interactions with family, friends, and colleagues.
5. Personal growth: Counseling can be a powerful tool for personal growth and development. Through therapy, you can learn to identify and challenge limiting beliefs and behaviors, and work towards becoming the best version of yourself.
6. Improved mental health: Counseling can help you manage symptoms of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research has shown that counseling can lead to significant improvements in mental health and well-being.
7. Reduced stigma: Counseling can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, as it promotes a more open and accepting attitude towards mental health.
8. Improved physical health: Studies have shown that counseling can have a positive impact on physical health, including lower blood pressure, improved sleep quality, and reduced chronic pain.
9. Accessibility: Counseling is widely available and accessible, with many therapists offering online or telephone sessions for those who may have difficulty accessing in-person therapy.
10. Cost-effective: Counseling is often covered by insurance, making it a cost-effective option for mental health support.

In conclusion, counseling can be a highly effective form of therapy for a wide range of mental health issues. By providing a safe space to process emotions, developing self-awareness, learning coping skills, improving relationships, and promoting personal growth, counseling can lead to significant improvements in mental health and well-being. While it's normal to have doubts and questions about the effectiveness of counseling, the evidence suggests that it can be a powerful tool for mental health support.",1.2821681499481201,0.010735051109012173,,0.272264631043257,0.05612244897959184,0.12213740458015267,0.8309121131896973,0.8358807563781738,0.8333889842033386,
"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck! </s>","tsk 😔 Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this kind of behavior from some people. It's never okay for someone to call you names or belittle you just because they're trying to make themselves feel better. 🤕
First of all, try not to let their words get to you. It's important to remember that their actions and words don't define your worth as a person. You are valuable and deserving of respect, regardless of what they say. 💪
If you find that their behavior is really affecting you, it might be helpful to talk to them about how their words are making you feel. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking them. For example, you could say something like, ""Hey, I've noticed that you've been calling me names lately, and it's really hurtful. Can we find a way to communicate that doesn't involve name-calling?"" 💬
If the behavior continues after you've talked to them, it might be best to distance yourself from the person or situation. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being. 🌟
Remember, you don't have to deal with this kind of behavior alone. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle the situation, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. 🤝

First of all, it might be helpful to try and identify the source of your anxiety in crowds. Is it specific situations or events that trigger your feelings of anxiety? Are there any particular sensory stimuli that make you feel uncomfortable? Once you can identify the root cause of your anxiety, you might be able to develop strategies to manage it.
In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help manage your anxiety in crowds:
* Practice deep breathing exercises: When you start to feel anxious in a crowd, try taking a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your body and mind.
* Find a safe space: If you're in a crowd and feeling overwhelmed, try to find a quiet spot where you can take a break and recharge. This could be a corner of a room, a separate room, or even just a few steps away from the main crowd.
* Use positive self-talk: When you're feeling anxious, it can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts. Try to counteract this by using positive self-talk. Instead of focusing on your anxiety, try to focus on things that make you feel good, like your accomplishments or your loved ones.
* Seek support: It can be really helpful to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. This could be a friend, family member, or mental health professional. Talking through your feelings can help you process them and feel more supported.
Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious sometimes. It's important to take care of yourself and seek support when you need it. You don't have to face this feeling alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. *smiles*

"Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it.

It's understandable that you may have feelings of disconnection or unhappiness in your marriage, but cheating is not a healthy way to address these feelings.

Rather than turning to cheating as a solution, it's important to have open and honest communication with your husband about your feelings and needs. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but it's important to be vulnerable and authentic about your feelings. Together, you can work towards finding ways to strengthen your marriage and address any underlying issues.

"I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area.

It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and disappointed in yourself when you know you're capable of better. Procrastination can be a tough habit to break, but it's important to remember that you're not alone and there are ways to overcome it.
Firstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and stuck. It's normal to feel this way, especially when you're facing a challenge that seems insurmountable. It's important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can.
Now, let's talk about some strategies that might help you break the cycle of procrastination. One thing that can be helpful is to identify the reasons behind your procrastination. Are you feeling overwhelmed by the task? Are you lacking motivation? Once you understand the reasons, you can start working on ways to address them. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you could break the task down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Or, if you're lacking motivation, you could find ways to make the task more interesting or rewarding.
Another strategy is to use the Pomodoro technique. This involves working in focused, 25-minute increments, followed by a five-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid distractions.
It's also important to create a conducive study environment. This could mean finding a quiet, comfortable space to study, or using noise-cancelling headphones to block out distractions.
Lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's a friend, family member, or academic advisor, don't be afraid to reach out for support.

 What if we think about this in metaphor: imagine a dirt road suddenly paved over - where before it was small, once paved, it was faster, smoother and suddenly you, the driver, knew what real driving could feel like. Then your road got a pothole: now, every time you drive, you hit that hole, and it only seems to get worse, the more you drive over it.  Until that hole is patched - until you choose to fill your heart with either love for another or love for yourself - you might find it challenging to 'keep driving on your road'. Instead of letting go of how you felt, try to hang on to that feeling, just direct it inwards: you've shared you're capable of feeling strongly for another, surely, you're worthy of that same regard?

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel a deep connection with someone, even if it's considered ""wrong"" by society. It's important to remember that love knows no boundaries, and it's okay to feel this way, even if it's not the socially accepted norm.
It's understandable that you don't want to be without the genuine love you feel for this person, but it's important to consider the bigger picture. It's important to think about your own well-being and happiness, and to consider whether staying in this situation is truly the best for you. It's okay to take time to process your feelings and to think about what you want for yourself.
One way to start moving on is to focus on self-care and self-compassion. Take time for yourself, engage in activities that make you happy, and practice self-love. It's important to remember that you deserve to be happy and to find love that is healthy and fulfilling.
Another way to move on is to find ways to honor and respect the feelings you have for this person. You don't have to cut them out of your life completely, but you can find ways to acknowledge and appreciate the connection you have without getting caught up in the same patterns of thinking and feeling.
Remember, moving on from someone you love is never easy, but it's possible. Take your time, be kind to yourself, and focus on your own well-being. With time and support, you can find a way to move forward in a way that feels true to you.
It's important to remember that you don't have to do this alone. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with additional support and guidance as you navigate this difficult time. They can help you process your feelings and find ways to move on in a healthy and fulfilling way.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel worthless at times, and it's important to give yourself permission to feel this way. It's okay to not be okay, and it's important to be kind to yourself as you work through these feelings.
Next, it may be helpful to try to identify the sources of these feelings. Are there specific events or experiences that are contributing to these feelings? Are there any negative self-talk patterns or beliefs that are perpetuating these feelings? Once you can identify the sources of these feelings, you can start to work on addressing them.
One way to address these feelings is through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of therapy that can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors, and replace them with more positive and constructive ones. A therapist can work with you to identify the distorted or unhelpful thinking patterns that are contributing to your feelings of worthlessness, and teach you new ways of thinking and behaving that can help you feel more positive and confident.
Another way to address these feelings is through self-care and self-compassion. It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally, when you're feeling worthless. This can involve engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, reading, or spending time with loved ones. It's also important to be kind and compassionate to yourself, and to practice self-compassion when you're feeling down.
Finally, it may be helpful to reach out for support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a powerful way to gain perspective and feel less alone. You can also seek out support groups or online forums where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

It's completely normal to feel this way, especially during the teenage years. It can be challenging to navigate the ups and downs of life, especially when it feels like everything is changing so quickly.
Firstly, it's important to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people, including myself, have gone through similar experiences. It's okay to feel lost, unsure of yourself, and struggling to connect with others. It's important to remember that these feelings are temporary, and they will pass with time and support.
It's possible that you might be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Depression is a common mental health condition that can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and disconnection from others. If you're feeling these feelings consistently and they're interfering with your daily life, it might be worth speaking with a mental health professional. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide support during this challenging time.
However, it's also possible that you're just going through a normal phase of adolescence. Teenagers often experience mood swings and can feel disconnected from their friends and family. This can be especially true during times of change, like the transition to college. It's important to remember that these feelings are normal and will pass with time.

1. Practice self-care: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This can include things like getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and doing activities that bring you joy.
2. Reach out to friends and family: It can be helpful to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. This can help you feel less alone and provide emotional support.
3. Try journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and understand them better. It can also be a helpful way to express yourself when you don't feel like talking to anyone else.

I think this type of situation can be common for many couples struggling with how to keep friendships with past relationships while being in a new relationship. For me, more information is needed here...but given the information provided, the way I interpret the question is...I'm assuming your boyfriend didn't know you were going to spend the weekend with your good friend?  Working off of this assumption, I would suggest beginning an open and honest dialogue with your boyfriend about what specifically upset him? And to talk about your point of view regarding spending the weekend with him. I would also suggest talking about how you both envision your relationship when it comes to spending time with others. If you feel like you can't have this conversation without it going off track, please consider seeing a couples therapist.

Hello there! Thank you for reaching out for support. It sounds like you're going through a difficult situation, and I'm here to listen and offer guidance.
Firstly, it's completely understandable that you might have feelings for your ex, even if the relationship didn't work out. It's normal to have mixed emotions after a breakup, and it's important to acknowledge and validate those feelings.
However, it's important to consider how your actions might affect your current relationship. Spending the weekend with your ex without consulting your boyfriend first can understandably upset him, and it's important to prioritize open communication and honesty in any relationship.
My advice would be to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and the situation with your ex. It might feel uncomfortable or awkward, but it's important to be vulnerable and honest with each other. You can also try to find ways to rebuild trust and work on moving forward together.
Remember, communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to prioritize your partner's feelings and needs.

"This is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets.

2. Challenge negative self-talk: When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts about your appearance, try to reframe them in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking ""I hate my face,"" try thinking ""I have a unique and beautiful face that makes me who I am.""
3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than focusing on your perceived flaws, try to focus on your strengths and the things you like about yourself.
4. Seek out positive role models: Surround yourself with people who are confident and comfortable in their own skin – they can be a great source of inspiration and support.

It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.I would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn't much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you.

"Great question. The decision to pursue therapy can be a very difficult one and the fact that there seem to be so many profiles that you have to wade through can be particularly daunting. Here's what I suggest to make the process a bit easier: 1) Narrow down your preferred geographical area. Are you in a rural, suburban, or urban environment? If it's either of the latter two, you'll probably have a mental health professional close by. Decide now if it's important to you that their office be within walking or short driving distance. 2) Decide if you need it to be covered by your insurance. You'll have more options if you're willing to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed by your insurance, but more and more people are accepting insurance these days. 3) Find someone whose profile has the key words that you're looking for. If you're struggling with traumatic flashbacks, make sure they have ""trauma"" or something along those lines in their profile.4) Make sure they have a friendly and professional picture. This is small, but this detail shows that they really care about how they present to the world. 5) Come up with a list of about 3 people and rank them from most appealing to least.

"Hi Texas, Thanks for your honesty; it helps me know where to go in answering you. What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful/abusive/controlling with you, and then you ask ""Should we call it quits?"". We? I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours, rather than yours together. The way your husband treats you is not your fault, Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you don't feel safe enough to be honest with a person you're supposed to be able to trust.There's an analogy that I sometimes use; I don't know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story, but it's powerful either way, so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water, the frog will jump out immediately, knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot, it will die. If you take a frog, however, and put it in a pot of cold water, and slowly, slowly, heat it to boiling, the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot; by the time it realises it's dying, it has lost its strength. It's called ""learned helplessness"". When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time, you get used to that, and you fail to see the options that are available to you. You have a toddler, and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. In my experience, and what research backs up, is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse. This is a complex picture, and if you were my client, I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you're seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions, but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child. I sincerely hope you seek professional help, with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist.

It's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean that you're crazy or that there's anything wrong with you.
One way to approach this feeling is to try to understand where it's coming from. What are the sources of your anxiety about living forever? Is it the thought of being in one place or situation for an extended period of time? Is it the idea of losing your sense of self or identity? Once you understand the root of your anxiety, you may be able to find ways to address it.
Another thing to consider is the idea that life after death may not be exactly what you think it is. While some religions teach a clear idea of what happens after we die, others leave the concept more open to interpretation. It's possible that the afterlife is not a fixed, static place, but rather a journey or a process of growth and transformation.
It may also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings about life after death, and offer support and guidance as you navigate these complex emotions.
Remember, it's okay to have questions and doubts about life after death. It's a natural part of being human, and it doesn't mean that you're not spiritual or religious. Instead, try to approach these feelings with an open mind and heart, and see where they take you.
In conclusion, you are not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the thought of living forever. It's a common and normal feeling, and there are many ways to address it.

"Assuming there are no medical explanations for this issue, many men I've worked with on this come to see it as essentially a form of Anxiety. There is a phenomenon called the Yerkes Dodson Law (see below; source: Wikipedia), which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress, pressure, or nervousness about a task, it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully. The ideal amount of stress/arousal is right in the middle - not too little and not too much. This applies to more things than we might often realize - from giving a presentation, to ordering food, to making a free throw, to driving, to sexual intimacy as in this case. A common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue, and for a temporary period of time, agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms, and without the expectation of intercourse. There are many ways to go about that (which are outside the scope of this blog article), but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety - and over time, can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive.

It's important to remember that erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common and treatable condition. There are many potential causes of ED, including physical, psychological, and lifestyle factors. Here are some possible causes of your symptoms:
1. Physical causes: ED can be caused by a variety of physical factors, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and prostate surgery. These conditions can reduce blood flow to the penis, making it difficult to achieve and maintain an erection.
2. Psychological causes: Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and relationship issues can also contribute to ED. These issues can lead to emotional distress, which can in turn affect sexual desire and performance.
3. Lifestyle causes: Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise can also contribute to ED. These factors can reduce blood flow to the penis and lead to decreased sexual function.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help improve your sexual function:

1. Communication: Communication is key in any relationship. Talk to your partner about your symptoms and how they are affecting you. Be open and honest about your feelings, and listen to your partner's perspective as well.

2. Exercise: Regular exercise can improve blood flow throughout the body, including the penis. This can help improve sexual function and overall health.

3. Stress reduction: Stress can exacerbate ED symptoms. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.

4. Sleep: Getting enough sleep is important for overall health and well-being, including sexual function. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.

5. Sexual activity: Engaging in sexual activity can help improve sexual function. However, it's important to avoid pushing yourself too hard or engaging in activities that cause discomfort or pain.

"The are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with. One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example ""I'm scared of spiders."" But if you change the thinking from being scared to ""I'm bigger than the spider,"" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. Mindfulness-based therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious. Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings, remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety.

4. Practice bladder training: Bladder training can help him learn to control his bladder better. You could try doing small exercises together, like taking a few sips of water and then stopping, or going to the bathroom at set times during the day.

"Hello, and thank you for your question. You are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts, too.

First, good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all
else. 
To answer your heading question, yes, it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other people’s actions. There are various
reasons why we do this. For one thing, someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that
person, past experiences, and our self-esteem, we may actually start to believe
it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for, not the other way around. 
As for the other things you mentioned, I am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem, and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school. 
You may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some
states, what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services, but not necessarily. If you are concerned
about that, ask the counselor what they are obligated to report. 
If you don’t know a counselor, think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas. 
Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able
to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random
searches, not every website is good, so be careful. 
This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in, so one of the
things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If
you have interests, do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things, try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care
of yourself in other ways, such as eating well. Exercise can really help when
we get stressed. 
I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck.

 Hello and thanks for your question! It's important to have the right therapist. I encourage you to start by checking out the website of the therapist. Their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you. If there's an email listed, go ahead and reach out. Ask the particular questions that are on your mind. Share a little of what you are looking for in a therapist. Are you a goal-direct, solution-focused individual who is looking for someone to listen and ask questions? Are you less self-directive and desire a therapist who can give you the consistent push to move forward? Are you interested in intertwining certain theory approaches? Maybe a cognitive-base or experiential? Art therapy or engaging in exercise while talking? Your therapist is out there. It's OK to try out a therapist for a session or two. Interview them as they interview you. It's also OK to change therapists; ask your present therapist for a referral. He or she should be willing to provide you with names of other providers and there's no shame in asking for it. You deserve to work with someone who fits your style!I imagine there's already enough things happening in your life if you are searching for a therapist. Do you really want to ""train"" your therapist? After all, you are paying them for their knowledge and expertise. It does take time to develop a relationship and developing one with your therapist is vital to your growth and satisfaction. Participating in therapy, for the most part, should be a time you anticipate and not avoid. Can you be honest with them? Are you trusting of the confidentiality they provide? Has this person clearly shared with you the limits of confidentiality if using insurance versus paying privately? Is there any part of you that ""just isn't sure""? It's okay to assert yourself in therapy. As a therapist, I invite you to assert yourself as it's a way to develop self-confidence and resiliency. Not everyone thrives in therapy by sitting in an office or lounging on a couch. Some folks benefit by challenging themselves in various environments, or are more comfortable in their homes, online, in the community, at a retreat, etc. Give yourself a gift of spending some time finding the person that can work with you towards what you are searching. Although there's the convenience of the local non-profit agency in your area, it may not be what you need. Also, limiting yourself to the names of providers listed on your insurance may not lead to the ""right one"". There are many forms of therapy that insurances refuse to cover.

1. Practice deep breathing exercises: When we're feeling anxious, our breathing can become shallow and rapid. Taking a few moments to focus on deep, slow breaths can help calm the body and mind.
2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Even a short walk or some light stretching can help.
3. Try progressive muscle relaxation: This involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head. As you tense each muscle group, hold for a few seconds, and then release.
4. Use positive self-talk: When we're feeling anxious, it can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts. Try using positive affirmations to counteract these thoughts. For example, you could say to yourself, ""I am strong and capable of handling this situation.""
5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment, without judgment. Try paying attention to your breath, your body, or your surroundings without getting caught up in thoughts or worries.
Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious sometimes. It's important to be kind to yourself and to reach out for support when you need it. Things might not feel better right away, but with time and effort, you can learn to manage your anxiety and feel more like yourself again.

You could also ask your fiancé how he feels about the situation and if he has any concerns or suggestions for how to move forward.
Another option is to seek mediation or counseling services to help you and your fiancé work through your differences and find a solution that works for everyone. A neutral third party can help facilitate a conversation and provide guidance on how to navigate this complex situation.
It's also important to consider the needs and feelings of your fiancé's other child. While it may be difficult to leave behind their other child, it's important to prioritize their well-being and consider how moving away could impact them.

"Your life here matters and being present in it so you feel joy in yourself and your surroundings is important in creating your sense of ease and balance. No one can predict, for sure, what happens after death because consciousness transcends boundaries and limits we tend to impose on it. That said, if reincarnation exists or if there is a heaven or hell your consciousness of it will most likely be free of discomfort or pain as you experience it now.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with similar thoughts and feelings, and it's okay to feel this way. It's important to be kind to yourself and to try to approach these thoughts with compassion and understanding.
One way to think about this is to consider the idea that life after death might not be exactly what we expect it to be. While some religions teach that there is a clear division between heaven and hell, others offer more nuanced understandings of the afterlife. For example, some belief systems view the afterlife as a place of transition and growth, where individuals can learn and evolve beyond the limitations of their physical bodies.
Another perspective is to consider the idea that death is not an end, but rather a transition to a new chapter in our journey. This can be a comforting thought, as it suggests that our lives are not limited to the time we spend in this physical world.
It's also worth noting that many people find comfort and meaning in the idea of an afterlife, as it can provide a sense of hope and purpose in the face of death. While it's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed by this concept, it's important to remember that it can also be a source of solace and strength.
Ultimately, the way you feel about the idea of living forever is okay. It's normal to have mixed feelings about something as profound and complex as death and the afterlife. What's important is to be kind to yourself and to seek out support from loved ones, or a mental health professional if you're struggling to cope with these thoughts.

"Being a parent can be all-consuming.  And there are more societal pressures on mothers to be everything to their children and families.  In that effort to be everything (cook, housekeeper, planner, social organizer, teacher, etc) it can be easy to forget about being you.  We can certainly acknowledge that becoming a mother likely means giving up or sacrificing parts of yourself for motherhood.  There are parts of becoming a mother that can be wonderful and magical, and parts of it that can be just flat out hard.  I think it is very important however, for all parents to ask for what they need and to carve out the time to nurture their individuality.  This may not only be supportive to you, but it sets a great example for your kids about how to advocate for their needs, and teach them about the depth and interests of their mother. </s>","completely normal to feel lost and unsure of your identity, especially when you're in the midst of raising a family. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day responsibilities of motherhood and wifehood that you forget to take care of yourself and your own needs. It's important to remember that taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own happiness is not selfish – it's essential for being the best mother and partner you can be.

First of all, let me say that you're not alone in this feeling. Many women go through this same struggle, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure of who you are outside of your roles as mother and wife. It's important to remember that your identity is not solely defined by these roles. You are more than just a mom and a wife – you are a unique and valuable person with your own interests, hobbies, and passions.
One way to start reconnecting with your pre-motherhood identity is to make time for yourself and do things that bring you joy and fulfillment. This might be as simple as taking a relaxing bath, reading a book, or going for a walk by yourself. It might also involve pursuing hobbies or interests that you had before you became a mother – whether that's painting, writing, gardening, or anything else that brings you happiness.
Another important thing to remember is that it's okay to feel unhappy and trapped at times. It's normal to feel this way, especially when you're in the midst of raising a family. However, it's important to recognize when these feelings are becoming overwhelming and to seek support from your partner, friends, or a therapist. Talking through your feelings with someone who understands can be incredibly helpful in finding ways to cope with them.

"Hello, and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, ""I want to be more confident"" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help. Be well,Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC </s>","completely understandable to feel stuck in a rut and struggle to make changes in your life. It's important to remember that changing habits and behaviors takes time and effort, and it's okay to face challenges along the way. Here are some things you can try to help you make those changes:
1. Start small: Instead of trying to make big changes all at once, try starting with small, manageable steps. For example, if you want to eat healthier, start by replacing one unhealthy meal per day with a healthier option.
2. Set realistic goals: Be specific about what you want to achieve, and set a timeline for reaching those goals. Break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Track your progress: Keeping track of your progress can help you stay motivated and see how far you've come. Use a journal, spreadsheet, or app to track your progress.
4. Find support: Share your goals with a friend or family member and ask for their support. Having someone to hold you accountable and provide encouragement can make it easier to stay on track.
5. Practice self-compassion: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.
6. Celebrate your successes: Take time to acknowledge and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This can help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue working towards your goals.
7. Seek professional help: If you're struggling to make changes in your life despite your best efforts, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can help you identify underlying issues and develop strategies to overcome them.
Remember, making changes in your life takes time, effort, and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't give up. Keep working towards your goals, and you will eventually see progress.

"First step is to remove the label of your behavior as a syndrome and instead understand the reasons for it.""Imposter syndrome"" sounds like a name someone made up to write a book and have lots of people buy it bc it gives the feeling they know themselves by calling themselves this name.Instead, consider your own unique qualities including your fears of being recognized as adding value to people's lives.If you were told growing up that you're worthless, or if your chosen career goes against family advice and expectations, or if you simply are a shy person, then these would be the starting points to understand your reluctance to believe in yourself.The more you understand yourself and trust the truths you find as to who you are, the less you will feel fraudulent.Good luck in your career work! </s>","completely normal to feel like an imposter sometimes, especially when you're in a challenging and high-pressure environment like graduate school. It's important to remember that everyone feels this way at some point or another, and it doesn't define your worth or abilities as a student. Here are some things that might help you overcome this feeling:
1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and try not to beat yourself up over these feelings. Remember that everyone has moments of self-doubt, and it's okay to feel this way.
2. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your perceived weaknesses, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Remind yourself of your achievements and the reasons why you were accepted into graduate school in the first place.
3. Seek support: Talk to your friends, family, or a therapist about how you're feeling. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and provide a different perspective.
4. Reframe your thinking: Try to reframe your thinking around the idea that you're not a fraud, but rather someone who is still learning and growing. Everyone makes mistakes and has areas for improvement, and that's okay.
5. Take breaks and practice self-care: Graduate school can be incredibly demanding, both intellectually and emotionally. Make sure to take breaks and practice self-care to help manage your stress levels.
6. Set realistic goals and celebrate your achievements: Setting realistic goals and celebrating your achievements can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose. This can help to counteract the feelings of imposter syndrome.
7. Seek out mentorship: Finding a mentor who can offer guidance and support can be incredibly helpful in overcoming feelings of imposter syndrome. They can provide valuable advice and help you build your confidence.
8. Try to challenge your negative self-talk: When you notice negative self-talk creeping in, try to challenge those thoughts with more positive and realistic ones. For example, instead of thinking ""I'm a fraud,"" try thinking ""I'm a capable and talented graduate student who is learning and growing every day.""
9. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices such as meditation or deep breathing can help you stay present and focused, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts and feelings of imposter syndrome.
10. Remind yourself of your values: When you're feeling like an imposter, it can be helpful to remind yourself of your values and why you're pursuing graduate school in the first place. This can help you stay motivated and focused on your goals.

"Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say ""I need answers to all my questions"". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say ""I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth.""

"I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles. One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him.

You could also express your own feelings of insecurity or jealousy, and work together to find ways to address these feelings in a healthy and constructive manner.

"There's a narrative approach that we call nightmare ""rescripting"" that may be helpful.Since we can't really control the nature of our dreams while they're happening, we try to alter them while we are in a waking state.  In a nutshell, this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have. Typically, there is an element of fear, danger or helplessness.Second, we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment, control, competence, and/or safety. In other words, if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted, we might change the events of the story so that you call the police, get to a place of safety, or even fight back and protect yourself.Third, you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again, so that it becomes a well rehearsed story. The effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping, this new, more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream.

Counseling can help you identify and change negative thought patterns, improve your coping skills, and develop more effective ways of dealing with stress and anxiety.
In counseling, you'll have the opportunity to explore the underlying causes of your depression and anxiety, and work with a trained therapist to develop strategies for managing these feelings. This can involve learning relaxation techniques, identifying triggers for your symptoms, and developing more positive thought patterns.
One of the most important things to remember is that counseling is a process, and it may take some time to see noticeable improvements. It's important to be patient and consistent with your therapy sessions, as this will help you to get the most out of the treatment.
I would encourage you to keep an open mind and be willing to try new things in counseling. Everyone's experience is different, and it may take some trial and error to find the approach that works best for you.

"Teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind - so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development. You are not at all alone.You've taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware! The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts, the more you can learn to manage them. Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try - for example, identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response, such as taking a deep breath, informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space, or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk. Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out, you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as ""I am responsible for my efforts"" and ""Blame is not helpful for anyone"" and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight. When you practice thinking more rational, healthy thoughts, you are actually rewiring your brain, so practice is key! </s>","completely normal to experience mood swings as a teenager, especially during this time of transition and growth. It's important to remember that these mood swings are temporary and will subside as you get older.

Firstly, it's important to understand that mood swings are caused by a combination of hormonal changes and emotional changes. During puberty, your body is undergoing significant changes, which can lead to fluctuations in your mood and emotions. It's common for teenagers to feel more emotional and sensitive during this time.


Secondly, it's possible that you may be experiencing a form of emotional regulation known as ""reactivity."" This means that you may be more prone to reacting strongly to situations or stimuli, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. This can lead to irritability and blame-shifting when things don't go as planned.



Thirdly, it's important to recognize that blaming others for your own emotions and actions is not a healthy coping mechanism. It's important to take responsibility for your own emotions and to learn how to manage them in a healthy way. This may involve practicing self-reflection, identifying triggers for your mood swings, and learning how to regulate your emotions in a more constructive way.

"Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. That's a complex injury. I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here.

I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden.

1. Allow yourself to feel your emotions: It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings, rather than trying to suppress or deny them. Allow yourself to feel angry, hurt, or any other emotion that comes up. Give yourself permission to feel these emotions, and try to process them in a healthy way.
2. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on your ex's happiness, try to focus on your own well-being. Remind yourself that you deserve to be happy too, and that you have the power to create your own happiness.
3. Set boundaries: If seeing your ex's posts on Facebook is triggering for you, try to limit your exposure to them. You can unfollow or block them, or take a break from social media for a while. Remember, you don't have to be exposed to things that make you feel uncomfortable or unhappy.
4. Focus on the present: Rather than dwelling on the past or comparing yourself to your ex, try to focus on the present moment. Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help you stay grounded in the present.

"It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling </s>","completely understandable to feel frustrated and angry when someone you love is struggling with a debilitating illness like Alzheimer's. It's natural to feel guilty when you're feeling angry or frustrated towards a loved one who is suffering from a condition that is beyond their control.
Firstly, it's important to recognize that your feelings are valid and normal. It's okay to feel frustrated or angry when someone is behaving in a way that is inconsistent with their usual personality or when they are making unrealistic or silly requests. It's important to remember that this behavior is a result of the disease and not a reflection of your loved one's personality or worth as a person.
Here are some coping strategies that may help you manage your feelings and provide support to your mother:
1. Practice empathy and compassion: Try to put yourself in your mother's shoes and understand that she may not have control over her actions or requests. Show her compassion and empathy, even if she is behaving in a way that is difficult for you.
2. Set boundaries: It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being. It's okay to say no to requests that are unrealistic or that you cannot fulfill. Be honest and direct in your communication, but also be kind and compassionate.
3. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and advice. Sharing your experiences and feelings with others who are going through similar situations can be incredibly helpful.
4. Take care of yourself: Make sure to take time for yourself and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of yourself can help you manage your stress and anxiety levels, which can be beneficial for both you and your mother.
5. Consider professional help: If you are feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope with your mother's behavior, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with additional support and coping strategies to manage your feelings and provide care for your mother.
Remember, it's okay to feel angry or frustrated, but try to respond in a way that is compassionate and understanding. By taking care of yourself and seeking support, you can manage your feelings and continue to provide the best possible care for your mother.",1.7814209461212158,0.04909295342055286,,0.3801418439716312,0.10241820768136557,0.1673758865248227,0.8436582088470459,0.8467092514038086,0.8451809883117676,

Are they trained in evidence-based therapies that have been shown to be effective for your specific issues?

3. Communication and collaboration: How well do you communicate with your therapist? Do you feel like they listen to your concerns and work collaboratively with you to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs? Effective communication is essential for successful therapy.
4. Personal compatibility: Do you feel like you ""click"" with your therapist? Are their values and approach to therapy aligned with your own? A good therapeutic relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and shared values.

As for training your therapist, it's important to remember that therapy is a collaborative process, and you play an active role in shaping your treatment plan. Here are some ways you can work with your therapist to ensure you're getting the support you need:
1. Be open and honest: Share your thoughts, feelings, and concerns with your therapist. Be honest about what's working and what's not, and don't be afraid to ask for changes or adjustments to your treatment plan.

7. Create a cozy morning environment: Make the morning environment as cozy and comfortable as possible, by keeping the room warm and dimly lit, and by providing a favorite toy or blanket.
8. Try a different pick-up spot: Sometimes, the pick-up spot can be a source of comfort for a child. Try picking your child up from a different location, such as the bedroom instead of the living room, and see if that makes a difference.
9. Offer a distraction: Sometimes, a distraction can help a child feel more comfortable and secure when they wake up. Try offering a toy or game to play with, or even just a simple distraction like a sticker or a small toy.
10. Be consistent: Consistency is key when it comes to helping a child feel secure and comfortable in the mornings. Try to be consistent in your approach and routine, even if it takes some time for your child to adjust.

It's important to remember that it's normal for children and teenagers to feel stressed or overwhelmed at times, especially during periods of significant change or increased expectations.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your daughter's feelings. Let her know that you understand she's feeling upset and that it's okay to feel that way. Sometimes, simply listening and offering empathy can go a long way in helping your daughter feel heard and understood.
It's also important to encourage your daughter to express her feelings and concerns to you or another trusted adult. This can help her feel more supported and less alone in her struggles. You could also suggest that she talk to her teacher or school counselor about her feelings, as they may be able to offer additional support or coping strategies.
In terms of whether or not to seek professional help, it's important to consider your daughter's overall well-being and the severity of her stress and anxiety. If she's experiencing persistent and intense stress that's impacting her daily life, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor can work with your daughter to identify the underlying causes of her stress and develop coping strategies to manage it.
In the meantime, there are some things you can do at home to help your daughter manage her stress and anxiety. Here are a few suggestions:
1. Encourage relaxation techniques: Teach your daughter deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery to help her relax and calm down when she's feeling stressed.
2. Practice positive self-talk: Encourage your daughter to talk to herself in a positive and supportive way. Help her come up with phrases like ""I can do this"" or ""I'm strong and capable"" to repeat to herself when she's feeling anxious.
3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can be a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Encourage your daughter to engage in physical activities she enjoys, such as dancing, drawing, or playing sports.

Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"".

1. Start with empathy: Acknowledge your sister's feelings and experiences. Let her know that you understand she's going through a tough time and that you're there to support her.
Example: ""Hey sis, I can see that you're going through a really hard time right now. I'm here for you and want to help in any way I can.""
2. Be non-judgmental: Avoid making assumptions or judgments about your sister's situation. Instead, focus on offering support and understanding.
Example: ""I know you're struggling, and I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and unhappy sometimes.""
3. Use ""I"" statements: Express your concerns using ""I"" statements, which can help your sister feel less defensive and more open to hearing your perspective.
Example: ""I've noticed that you've been sleeping a lot more lately, and I'm worried about your health. I want to make sure you're taking care of yourself.""
4. Offer help: Let your sister know that you're willing to help her in any way you can. This could mean helping her with household chores, cooking meals, or simply being a listening ear.
Example: ""Is there anything I can do to help? Whether it's running errands or just being here for you, I want to support you.""
5. Be patient: It may take time for your sister to open up and be receptive to your support. Be patient and continue to show her that you care.
Example: ""I know it's not easy to talk about, but I want to hear how you're feeling. Can we take things slow and talk when you're ready?""

"Betrayal in a relationship can be one of the most difficult things a relationship can sustain. Sometimes feelings about the betrayal may also trigger past wounds.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the hurt and betrayal that you must be feeling right now. It's not uncommon for people to feel a range of emotions after discovering that their partner has cheated, including anger, sadness, and confusion. It's important to give yourself time to process your emotions and to prioritize your own well-being during this time.
It's understandable that your partner may want to work on rebuilding your relationship, but it's important to remember that you have the right to make decisions about your own happiness and well-being. It's okay to take time for yourself to think about what you want and need, and to prioritize your own healing and growth.
In terms of whether it's possible to get past the cheating and move forward in your relationship, it really depends on the specific circumstances and the individuals involved. If the cheating was a one-time mistake, and your partner is genuinely remorseful and willing to work on rebuilding trust, it may be possible to move forward. However, if the cheating was a pattern of behavior, or if your partner is unwilling to take responsibility and work on rebuilding trust, it may be more difficult to move forward.
It's important to remember that healing and growing in a relationship takes time, effort, and commitment from both partners. It's okay to take things slowly and to prioritize communication, empathy, and mutual respect.
In terms of how to move forward, here are a few things you may want to consider:
1. Take time for yourself: It's important to prioritize your own well-being and to take time for yourself to process your emotions and think about what you want and need.
2. Communicate openly and honestly: It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and concerns. Be sure to listen to each other and to try to find common ground and solutions that work for both of you.
3. Focus on building trust: Trust is a fundamental component of any healthy relationship. It's important to focus on building trust and to prioritize communication, empathy, and mutual respect.
4. Consider couples therapy: If you're having trouble moving forward on your own, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive environment for you and your partner to work through your issues and to learn new communication and relationship skills.

In conclusion, it's important to remember that healing and growing in a relationship takes time, effort, and commitment from both partners.

It's understandable that you're feeling upset and uncertain after discovering that your ex-partner lied to you and broke promises. It's important to remember that you deserve to be treated with honesty and respect in a relationship, and it's okay to feel hurt and betrayed when those expectations are not met.
It's also important to consider the context of the situation. If your ex-partner has admitted to lying to you and has apologized, it may be a sign that they are taking responsibility for their actions and are willing to work towards rebuilding trust. However, it's also possible that the lies and broken promises may be a sign of deeper issues, such as a lack of empathy or a pattern of unhealthy behavior.

It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your ex-partner about your feelings and concerns, and to set clear boundaries and expectations for the future.

"Being able to accept your partner's influence is a key relationship skill. And it's very two sided.  Chances are if you don't feel your partner is being influenced by you, they likely don't feel you are being influenced by them either. The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence.  Play with it. </s>","nselor}: Ah, I see. It can be really challenging when communication breaks down due to one person's difficulty in accepting what the other person is saying. It's important to address this issue as it can lead to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and damaged relationships.
Firstly, it's essential to identify the root cause of the problem. Are there any unresolved conflicts or issues between the two people? Are there any communication barriers, such as language or cultural differences? Once you have identified the cause, you can start working on finding a solution.
One approach is to have an open and honest conversation with the person who is having trouble accepting what you are saying. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking the other person. For example, you could say, ""I feel frustrated when you don't accept what I'm saying because I feel like we're not communicating effectively.""
Another approach is to use active listening techniques. This involves paying close attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and restating what you heard to ensure you understand their perspective. By actively listening, you can help the other person feel heard and understood, which can go a long way in improving communication.
It's also important to be patient and non-judgmental when communicating with the person who is having trouble accepting what you are saying. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions, and instead focus on finding a solution that works for both parties.
Remember, communication is a two-way street, and it may take time and effort to improve it. But with empathy, patience, and a willingness to listen and understand each other, you can work towards finding a solution that works for everyone involved.

8. Plan fun activities: Having something to look forward to can help take your mind off the winter blues. Plan a fun activity or outing with friends or family, or try a new hobby or interest.
9. Eat a balanced diet: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can help improve your mood and energy levels. Avoid sugary and processed foods that can have a negative impact on your mood.
10. Consider supplements: Some supplements, such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to have a positive impact on mood. Consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

We feel shut down and that can be strange---a kind of disconnection.

"<s> <<SYS>> Respond accordingly to the provided context. Try to give adequate counseling to the user. Show empathetic responses and naturality when answering. <</SYS>> [INST] I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.
 Hi Winters, I'm so glad you wrote, because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). This current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness.  I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path? I hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. I wish you the best. </s>"," there, thank you for sharing your struggles with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these kinds of feelings, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. It's completely normal to feel anxious or worried about your sexual experience, especially when it seems like everyone else around you has already had their first kiss or is in a relationship.
First of all, let me say that you're beautiful inside and out, and your worth and identity are not defined by your sexual experience. You are so much more than just your virginity or lack thereof. It's important to remember that sex is a personal choice, and there's no rush to do it if you're not ready or comfortable. It's okay to take things at your own pace and to prioritize your own feelings and well-being.
I understand that you may feel pressured to engage in sexual activities to fit in or to seem ""normal,"" but I want to encourage you to focus on your own happiness and well-being instead. It's important to find a partner who respects and values you for who you are, and who will support you in your choices.
It's also important to remember that your sexual experience is your own, and you don't owe anyone an explanation or justification for it. You don't have to feel ashamed or embarrassed about your choices, and you don't have to compare yourself to others. You are unique and special in your own way, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.
If you're feeling pressure or temptation to engage in sexual activities that you're not comfortable with, it's important to reach out for support. You can talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about how you're feeling, and they can offer you guidance and encouragement.
Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you don't have to compromise on your values or boundaries. You are worthy of love and respect, and you will find someone who will treat you with the care and attention you deserve.
Keep in mind that it's okay to take things at your own pace, and you don't have to rush into anything that you're not comfortable with. Your sexual experience is yours to own and enjoy, and you don't have to compare yourself to others or feel pressured to fit in. You are unique and special, and you deserve to be treated with love and respect.

I don't really like other people (I prefer animals) they make me nervous and scared.
 I am very sorry to hear that you are going through this!
While animals can be a wonderful way to experience emotional support, you may
want to consider opening up to a Life Coach or therapist to discuss some of
your concerns. You are not alone, and many people are experiencing very similar
anxieties. A Life Coach or professional therapist could help to guide you
through these emotions and refer you to additional professional help if needed.
It sounds as though you want to address some of these issues by first asking
the question. Finding additional support from a trained professional whom you
feel comfortable with could be the best way to get the help that you need. I

It's common for people to feel more anxious in situations where they feel trapped or unable to escape. It's important to remember that you don't have to face this feeling alone.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and accept your feelings. It's okay to feel anxious or overwhelmed in crowds, and it's important to be kind to yourself as you work through these feelings.
One strategy you could try is to practice deep breathing exercises when you find yourself in a crowded situation. Take slow, deliberate breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath in your body. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce feelings of anxiety.
Another strategy is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or past. When you find yourself in a crowd, try to bring your attention to the sights, sounds, and sensations around you. This can help you feel more grounded and centered in the moment.
It's also important to remember that it's okay to set boundaries for yourself when it comes to social situations. If you find that you're feeling overwhelmed in crowds, it may be helpful to take breaks and find a quiet space to yourself. This can help you recharge and feel more comfortable in social situations.
Finally, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional about your feelings of anxiety in crowds. A therapist can help you explore the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop strategies for managing it in a healthy way.

However, it's okay if you don't feel ready to date again right now. It's important to listen to your own emotions and needs, and not feel pressured into something that doesn't feel right for you. Take the time you need to heal and focus on yourself, and when you're ready, you can explore dating again.
It's also possible that you may not be ready to date again because there are unresolved emotions or issues from the previous relationship that need to be addressed.

"Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer.

"Anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you. When we are on high alert, we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature.  To some extent this is normal, for example, when people experience late onset deafness, they often will worry people are talking about them (and usually not good things) because our brains tend to jump to that. Of course, I'm not saying you are going deaf or anything, just giving an example. Counseling can help you work through this anxiety.

It can be really frustrating and disorienting when you're in a situation and suddenly think you've heard something that might have been meant for you, but you're not sure if it's actually true. It's important to remember that your thoughts and feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel confused or unsure in these situations.
It might be helpful to try and identify the source of the thought or comment that you're hearing. Is it someone you're close to, or is it a stranger? Are there any patterns or triggers that you've noticed in the past? Understanding the context of the thought can help you better understand where it's coming from and whether it's actually meant for you.
In the meantime, it might be helpful to practice mindfulness and grounding techniques to help you stay present and focused in the moment. This can help you avoid getting caught up in thoughts that might not be based in reality.

"Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members.It is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not, to expect both sides to get along harmoniously.In order to achieve this, the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism.This would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isn't part of summer camp for children.What you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism, is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administrators.Ultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write, the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates. </s>","completely understandable that you're looking for ways to keep the child with autism entertained and engaged during day camp. It's great that you're taking the time to consider his needs and finding ways to support him. However, it's important to also consider the feelings and needs of the other children at the camp. It's understandable that they may feel frustrated or upset when they see the child with autism receiving special treatment.
Here are some suggestions for how you can handle this situation:
1. Have an open and honest conversation with the other children: Use this opportunity to talk to the other children about autism and why the child with autism may need some extra support. Explain that everyone has different needs and abilities, and that it's okay to have differences. This can help the other children understand and empathize with the child with autism.
2. Involve the child with autism in group activities: While it's important to provide extra support for the child with autism, it's also important to include him in group activities as much as possible. Encourage the other children to play with him and include him in games and activities. This can help him feel more included and valued, and can also help the other children understand and appreciate his differences.
3. Find ways to make the activities more inclusive: Instead of just carrying cards around for the child with autism, try to find ways to make the activities more inclusive for everyone. For example, you could create a scavenger hunt that involves finding items related to nature, or you could play a game of ""Simon Says"" that involves different actions and movements. This can help the other children feel more engaged and included, while also providing support for the child with autism.
4. Seek additional support from the day camp administrator: If the other children are still feeling upset or frustrated, it may be helpful to seek additional support from the day camp administrator. They may be able to provide additional training or resources to help you support the child with autism and the other children in the camp.

Overall, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. By being open and honest with the other children, involving the child with autism in group activities, and finding ways to make the activities more inclusive, you can help create a more supportive and inclusive environment for everyone.",1.8540658950805664,0.007812507450598362,,0.26564885496183205,0.042879019908116385,0.14045801526717558,0.8244906663894653,0.833984375,0.8292104005813599,
"<s> <<SYS>> Respond accordingly to the provided context. Try to give adequate counseling to the user. Show empathetic responses and naturality when answering. <</SYS>> [INST] Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It’s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.
   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.
   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.
 If you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. Although you say you're happy, I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isn't greener...

It's understandable that you would still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend, especially since you had something meaningful together before his girlfriend came into the picture. It's also natural to feel drawn to someone who you have a connection with, even if they're in a relationship with someone else.
It's important to remember that you don't have to make any decisions or take any action right away. You're entitled to take the time you need to process your feelings and think about what you want to do next. It's okay to take a step back and focus on yourself and your current relationship with your current boyfriend.
One thing you might consider is talking to your ex-boyfriend about how you feel. As you mentioned, this could potentially be awkward or even blow up in your face, but it could also be an opportunity for both of you to be honest and open about your feelings. It's possible that he may have feelings for you as well, and that you could find a way to move forward together. Alternatively, he may not have feelings for you, and you can both move forward with your lives.
Another option is to focus on your current relationship and make sure you're taking care of yourself and your emotional needs. It's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own well-being.

In my experience, ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe. Some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others. When initiating conversations about this, try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality. A second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions.As far as whether God is real or not, consider trusting yourself and what you learn, feel, and believe as you work through this process. </s>","completely understandable to feel unsure or question the authenticity of beliefs, especially when it comes to something as complex and deeply personal as faith in God. It's important to remember that everyone has their own beliefs and experiences, and it's okay to have your own doubts and questions.
Firstly, it's important to recognize that faith is a personal journey, and it's okay to take your time to explore and understand what you truly believe in. It's not uncommon for people to question their beliefs at some point in their lives, and it's important to be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate through this process.
One way to approach this question is to think about what you mean by ""God."" Are you referring to a specific deity or higher power? Are you talking about a personal belief or a cultural/religious tradition? Understanding what you mean by ""God"" can help you better understand your question and explore your beliefs.
Another approach is to consider the evidence and reasons that support your belief in God. Have you experienced anything that you believe is evidence of God's existence? Have you read or heard anything that has convinced you of God's reality? Reflecting on the reasons behind your beliefs can help you better understand your convictions and make sense of any doubts or questions you may have.
It's also important to remember that faith is not necessarily about proof or evidence, but rather about trust and belief. Many people find comfort and meaning in their beliefs, even when they can't be proven or disproven.
Ultimately, the decision to believe in God or not is a personal one, and it's okay to take your time to explore and understand what you truly believe in.

We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family’s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn’t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn’t do it at all anymore. I was crushed!

Secondly, try to have an open and honest conversation with your ex about how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns in a respectful and non-accusatory manner.

It's important to remember that you are not defined by one event or one person's actions. You are a unique and valuable individual with so much to offer.
It's great that you are taking steps to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful in processing your feelings and developing coping strategies. It can also be helpful to talk to your partner about how you are feeling and to work together to find ways to support each other.
In addition to seeking professional help, there are some things you can try on your own to help work through these feelings:
1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Challenge negative self-talk: When you catch yourself thinking negative thoughts about yourself, try to reframe them in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking ""I'm so ugly,"" try thinking ""I'm beautiful inside and out.""
3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your perceived flaws, try to focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique and special.
4. Take small steps towards self-acceptance: Start by making small changes to your daily routine, such as taking a few minutes each day to practice self-compassion or taking a selfie to remind yourself of your beauty.
Remember, healing from past traumas takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it. You are not alone and you are worthy of love and happiness.

He's been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather.
 Family members sometimes get Power of Attorney over vulnerable adults. If you had this, you could do something like that. I'm assuming that you don't, though. There are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed, but it is a long process. I deal with situations like this everyday on the job. The only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor (such as at an emergency room) to be a threat to self or others. For instance, if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action, or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out, he could be placed on a short hold, but these holds only last for a few days. This still isn't a long-term solution. An adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices, no matter how bad those choices are. If you have a way to get him to an ER whenever things like that happen, such as being found sleeping outside in 12 degree weather, it will help a lot. They may or may not do a short term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the ER, but it's a start. They can help set him up with appointments for psych and he can get on medications. You can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled. However, you can't force him to take the meds, so this may be something that happens a lot. With enough of a paper trail of many ER visits and that sort of thing, you'll stand a better chance of getting a court appointed psych ward stay. Some tips about ER visits: Don't send him alone. Always go with him or have someone go with him, because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into what's going on than he will. He may say everything's fine and he wants to leave, so they won't have any reason to keep him if that is the case. Go with him. If you do get Power of Attorney, take the paperwork with you when you go to the ER and to doctor's appointments because they aren't just going to take your word. They need to see the actual paperwork. Having it on file in their system isn't good enough because paperwork expires, etc. Take it with you at all times. You can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of what's going on.Keep in mind that if you do get Power of Attorney, this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him. Otherwise, you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect. In fact, your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help. She won't be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills, but should be held responsible for his safety. Someone should. There are group homes for people with schizophrenia. "" Being responsible"" for someone doesn't mean you have to pay their bills, it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need. That care may be placement in a long-term care facility like a group home or a nursing home. Psych inpatient hospitals aren't long-term, so you do need to look into other long-term options. Psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him, they're not where someone stays forever.Good luck, and keep up the good attitude! Work with his treatment team. Ask for a social worker. If they see family that is wanting to do the right thing and wanting to help, they'll help you even if it does take a while to get things sorted out. The worst thing any of you can do is NOT go to appointments and that sort of thing. </s>","understandable that you're concerned about your brother's well-being and want to help him. However, as a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that signing someone into a mental health facility without their consent or proper legal authorization is not a viable or ethical solution.
Firstly, it's important to understand that schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that requires professional treatment and support. While it's understandable that your brother may not be taking his medication or engaging in harmful behaviors, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and respect for his autonomy.
If you're concerned about your brother's safety and well-being, there are other ways to support him. Here are some options you could consider:
1. Encourage your brother to seek professional help: Schizophrenia is a treatable condition, and with proper treatment, individuals can manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives. Suggest that your brother consult with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or therapist, who can provide him with the appropriate care and support.
2. Offer emotional support: Being diagnosed with a mental illness can be challenging and isolating. Let your brother know that you're there for him and offer emotional support. Listen to his concerns, provide reassurance, and encourage him to open up about his feelings.
3. Help him access resources: There are many organizations that provide resources and support for individuals with mental illnesses. Help your brother access these resources, such as counseling services, support groups, and hotlines.
4. Advocate for him: If your brother is unwilling or unable to seek help, you could consider advocating for him. This could involve speaking with his healthcare providers, social workers, or other support services to ensure that he receives the care and support he needs.

It's important to remember that signing someone into a mental health facility without their consent is not a legal or ethical solution. It's essential to approach the situation with empathy and respect for your brother's autonomy, while also ensuring his safety and well-being.

1. ""Hey sis, I wanted to talk to you about what happened with your husband. I'm really hurt and upset that he would say bad things about me, and I feel like you could have defended me more. Can we talk about why you didn't?""
2. ""I understand that you may not have wanted to get involved in our family drama, but I really needed your support and defense in that moment. Can we find a way to move forward and work through this together?""

5. ""I'm glad you're willing to listen and understand my perspective. Can we find a way to support each other and work through this together?""

"This is a great question. PTSD can be very complex and debilitating. It must be very difficult for you at this time.When we feel complex emotions such as anger, frustration, and possibly low-self worth, the tendency is to try to avoid or suppress these emotions. The more you avoid them, the more these emotions will express themselves, and at the worst times. This may be why your PTSD symptoms are harming your relationships and your job status.To help you get your life back, it is important to process your emotions with a counselor that has specific training in trauma-informed interventions. To process emotions, you start by inviting them in, observe them with compassion and without judgment. When we observe our emotions, it starts the healing process because we separate ourselves from them. Remember, thoughts and emotions are constructed. You are not your thoughts, nor your emotions. They are messengers telling you to pay attention to them.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you manage your symptoms and regain control over your life.
Firstly, it's essential to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who specializes in treating PTSD. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide a safe and supportive environment to process your emotions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a commonly used therapy for PTSD, which can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your symptoms.
In addition to therapy, there are several self-care strategies that can help manage PTSD symptoms. These include:
1. Practicing grounding techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to help calm your body and mind.
2. Engaging in physical activity, such as walking, running, or yoga, which can help reduce stress and anxiety.
3. Connecting with others through social support, such as talking to friends and family, joining a support group, or participating in group therapy.
4. Taking breaks and prioritizing self-care, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music.
5. Seeking professional help for any co-occurring mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety.

It's also important to remember that healing from PTSD is a process that takes time, patience, and effort. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to focus on small, manageable goals. Remember to be kind to yourself and to celebrate small victories along the way.
Lastly, remember that you don't have to go through this alone. Reach out to loved ones, friends, or mental health professionals for support. You can also join online support groups or forums where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
Remember, you are not alone, and there is hope for healing and recovery from PTSD.

If your coverage isn't that great and you know you're going to be paying for it all anyway (because you're an all-star and verified your coverage already with the insurance company), then you can really pick any Counselor you want, but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible. If you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once you've started counseling, Better is a good option. Once you've found a Counselor you think is a good fit for you, normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment. With many Counselors you can now send an email, but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic. Once you're all scheduled, they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in, or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there. From there, all you have to do is show up! </s>","great that you're considering seeking professional counseling! Starting the counseling process can seem daunting, but it's actually quite straightforward. Here are some steps you can take to get started:
1. Identify your needs: Reflect on what brought you to seek counseling in the first place. Is it anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or something else? Being clear about your needs will help you find the right counselor or therapist.
2. Research local therapists: Look for licensed therapists in your area who specialize in the area you need help with. You can search online, ask for referrals from friends or healthcare professionals, or check with your insurance provider for a list of covered therapists.
3. Check credentials and insurance coverage: Make sure the therapist you choose has the necessary education, training, and licensure. Also, confirm that they accept your insurance coverage to avoid any unexpected costs.
4. Schedule an initial consultation: Once you've narrowed down your search, contact the therapist to schedule an initial consultation. This typically lasts about 30 minutes and gives you an opportunity to get a sense of the therapist's approach, personality, and whether you feel comfortable with them.
5. Be honest and open: During the initial consultation, be honest and open about your reasons for seeking counseling. The therapist is there to listen and help, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts and feelings.
6. Set goals and expectations: Work with your therapist to identify your goals for counseling and what you hope to achieve. Be sure to communicate your expectations and any concerns you may have.
7. Commit to regular sessions: Consistency is key when it comes to counseling. Aim to attend sessions regularly, usually once a week or as agreed upon with your therapist.
Remember, seeking counseling is a brave and important step towards healing and growth. Don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it!",1.4666199684143066,0.0455921349282382,,0.4328767123287671,0.08791208791208792,0.1589041095890411,0.8445643782615662,0.8414199352264404,0.8429891467094421,
"Many people generate intense anxiety with obsessive thinking.  While the nature of your obsession about the afterlife and eternity appear very powerful and unique to you, the pattern of obsessing about one thing/area is common.  I suggest that you consider counseling to help you with your anxiety.  If you are so inclined, there are also medications which may bring relief.  Obviously, I can't diagnose you from one paragraph, so it would be wise to visit an experienced mental health professional (either a counselor or an MD in your area) to help you with disengaging from your self-destructive thoughts.  CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is a very effective counseling approach for obsessive thinking.  If you'd like a see a top notch CBT therapist, visit www.AcademyofCT.org.  And of course I suggest you pick up my book, LIVING YES, A HANDBOOK FOR BEING HUMAN, which includes CBT concepts and many more tools which will help with obsession and anxiety.As for believing yourself ""insane"" (or ""crazy"") this is not a mental health term but a legal one (or a slang).  So as long as you don't commit a crime, no professional can legitimately call you insane or crazy!Take it slow!  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org) </s>","completely normal to have questions and concerns about life after death, especially if you were raised in a religion that emphasizes the idea of an afterlife. It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the thought of living forever, as it can be difficult to wrap your head around the concept of an eternity. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and that many people struggle with similar thoughts and feelings.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's okay to have these thoughts and feelings. It's normal to feel uncertain or uneasy when confronted with big philosophical questions, and it's important to be kind to yourself as you explore these ideas. It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings, as they can offer support and help you process your emotions.
One way to approach this topic is to consider the idea of ""forever"" in a more abstract sense. Rather than thinking about the specifics of heaven or hell, try to focus on the idea of living in a world without end. What does that mean to you? How would you want to spend your time if you were living in a world without end? These questions can help you approach the concept of forever in a more positive light, and can give you a sense of what you might want to focus on in the afterlife.
Another perspective to consider is the idea of reincarnation. In some spiritual traditions, the belief is that the soul or consciousness is reborn into a new body after death. This can be a comforting idea for some people, as it allows them to think of death as a transition rather than an end.
It's also worth considering the idea of ""eternal growth"" rather than ""eternal life"". This idea is based on the belief that our souls or consciousness continue to evolve and grow after death, rather than simply existing in a static state. This can be a more positive and empowering way to think about the afterlife, as it suggests that there is always room for growth and development.
Finally, it's important to remember that death is a natural part of life, and that it's okay to feel scared or uncertain about it. Many people find comfort in the idea of death as a transition to a new phase of existence, rather than an end. It's okay to take your time and explore these ideas at your own pace, and to seek support from loved ones or mental health professionals if you need it.
In conclusion, it's completely normal to have questions and concerns about life after death, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed by the thought of living forever. Consider focusing on the idea of ""forever"" in a more abstract sense, or exploring the idea of reincarnation or ""eternal growth"". Remember that death is a natural part of life, and that it's okay to take your time and seek support if you need it.",1.6073321104049683,0.01487765375765222,,0.26432748538011697,0.04689331770222743,0.1216374269005848,0.8182844519615173,0.8104118704795837,0.8143291473388672,

Traumatic events, including car accidents, can often trigger or exacerbate existing mental health conditions like PTSD. It's important to seek professional help from a mental health provider to address any new or worsening symptoms.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that experiencing a car accident can be a traumatic event for anyone, regardless of their history of PTSD. The sudden and unpredictable nature of the accident can cause a range of emotional and psychological reactions, including anxiety, fear, and feelings of vulnerability. These reactions are completely normal and can be especially challenging for individuals who have experienced trauma in the past.
In terms of whether the accident could add more problems to your existing PTSD symptoms, it's possible that it could. Traumatic events can often trigger or exacerbate existing mental health conditions, and the recent accident may have caused additional stress and anxiety. However, it's important to note that everyone's experience with PTSD is unique, and the impact of a car accident on your symptoms will depend on various factors, including the severity of the accident, your personal response to the event, and any existing coping mechanisms or support systems you may have in place.
It's important to seek professional help from a mental health provider to address any new or worsening symptoms. A mental health professional can help you develop coping strategies and provide support and guidance as you navigate this challenging time. They can also help you identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to your symptoms and work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan.
In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage your symptoms:
1. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.
2. Seek social support: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for emotional support and to talk through your feelings.
3. Engage in grounding techniques: Grounding techniques can help you focus on the present moment and distract you from intrusive thoughts or feelings related to the accident. Examples include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or using your senses to focus on the present moment.
4. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of talk therapy that can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your PTSD symptoms.

Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and seek professional help if you're struggling with PTSD symptoms related to the car accident. With the right support and treatment, it is possible to manage symptoms and improve your overall well-being.

 Hello, My heart goes out to you, your brother, and your family, dealing with a very painful and difficult situation. In New York, you can't institutionalize someone else directly. You can, however, call the police or EMS. If they agree that he would benefit from hospitalization (and it sounds like they would), he can be held in the hospital for up to 72 hours, whether he agrees or not. Some hospitals will not hold a person that long, in spite of what we might want. I have seen many patients in and out of hospitals countless times, and it has been my experience that it can be extremely difficult to hold a person long enough to achieve good stability and an appropriate after-care plan. Hospitals in NYC tend to take a ""patch and release"" approach more often than I would like. It's been my experience that family makes a difference. Assertive, knowledgeable, persistent family can improve the quality of your loved one's care. Hospitals are highly pressured to discharge people quickly but they can not discharge a homeless person without someplace to go. If your family is willing to accept your brother, that will be the path of least resistance for the hospital. If the family refuses, they will be forced to find another path for him. You can also pressure the hospital to refer to rehab after psychiatrically stablized (which may only take a few days) and that may give your brother more time to begin making clear-headed decisions. If your brother has a psychiatrist, that person should be actively involved. I had a patient patched-and-released three times, in spite of my advocacy and him literally begging to remain and stop his voices. We finally got a 90 day hospitalization because I strong-armed his psychiatrist into demanding that the hospital stabilize his patient.  If your brother has a history of non--compliance with oral medications, you can push the hospital for injection, which again will help your brother stay stable for longer. Best wishes to you and your family. </s>"," completely understandable that you are concerned about your brother's well-being and want to help him. However, as a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that signing someone into a mental health facility without their consent or proper legal authorization is not a viable or ethical solution.
Firstly, it is important to recognize that your brother is an adult and has the legal right to make his own decisions regarding his medical treatment, including refusing to take medication. While it may be challenging to see him struggle with mental health issues, it is essential to respect his autonomy and decision-making capacity.
Secondly, involuntary commitment is a complex legal process that requires a thorough assessment of the individual's mental health status and a determination of whether they pose a risk to themselves or others. This process is typically conducted by a mental health professional and involves a series of evaluations and assessments.
Instead of taking matters into your own hands, I would recommend exploring the following options:
1. Encourage your brother to seek professional help: While it may be challenging to convince your brother to seek help, it is essential to emphasize the importance of professional treatment. Suggest that he consult with a mental health professional who can assess his condition and provide appropriate guidance.
2. Offer emotional support and resources: As a sibling, you may feel helpless in the face of your brother's mental health struggles. However, you can still offer emotional support and resources to help him cope with his condition. This may include accompanying him to therapy sessions, providing a listening ear, and offering practical help with daily tasks.
3. Seek legal advice: If you are concerned about your brother's well-being and feel that he is a danger to himself or others, you may want to seek legal advice. A mental health lawyer can provide guidance on the legal options available to you and help you navigate the process of involuntary commitment.
In summary, while it is understandable that you want to help your brother, signing him into a mental health facility without proper legal authorization is not a viable or ethical solution. Instead, focus on offering emotional support and resources, and seek legal advice if necessary. Remember, it is essential to respect your brother's autonomy and decision-making capacity while ensuring his safety and well-being.",1.6126919984817505,0.012980527373469478,,0.3674762407602956,0.04867724867724867,0.13093980992608237,0.8255101442337036,0.816585123538971,0.8210234045982361,

 Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor). </s>","completely normal to have doubts and questions about finding the right therapist and training them to provide the right support. Here are some things to consider when looking for the right therapist and how to communicate your needs effectively:
1. Trust your instincts: When searching for a therapist, pay attention to how you feel during the initial consultation. Do you feel comfortable and supported? Do you feel like you can trust them with your thoughts and feelings? If you don't feel a connection with your therapist, it's okay to keep looking.
2. Look for experience and qualifications: Make sure your therapist has the necessary education, training, and experience working with clients with concerns similar to yours. You can ask about their qualifications and experience during the initial consultation.
3. Consider your goals and needs: Think about what you want to achieve through therapy. Do you want to work on managing anxiety, improving relationships, or coping with grief? Find a therapist who specializes in these areas and has experience working with clients with similar concerns.
4. Ask questions: Don't be afraid to ask your therapist questions about their approach, experience, and qualifications. This will help you get a sense of whether they are the right fit for you.
5. Be open and honest: Communication is key in therapy. Be open and honest with your therapist about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This will help them understand your needs and provide effective support.
6. Set boundaries: It's important to establish clear boundaries and expectations with your therapist. Let them know what you are comfortable discussing and what you prefer to keep private.
7. Be patient: Building a strong therapeutic relationship takes time. Be patient and give your therapist the time and space they need to get to know you and provide effective support.

As for training your therapist, it's important to communicate your needs and expectations clearly and respectfully. Here are some tips:

1. Be specific: Let your therapist know what you want to work on during therapy. Be specific about your goals and concerns.
2. Be open to feedback: Remember that your therapist is there to help you. Be open to their feedback and suggestions, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification or additional support.
3. Practice active listening: Active listening is a crucial part of effective communication in therapy. Make sure to listen carefully to your therapist and respond thoughtfully.
4. Be consistent: Consistency is key in therapy. Make sure to attend sessions regularly and provide your therapist with feedback on your progress.
5. Show appreciation: Don't forget to show your therapist appreciation for their support and guidance. Acknowledge their efforts and let them know how much you value their help.

Remember, finding the right therapist and training them to provide the support you need takes time and effort. Be patient, communicate openly and honestly, and prioritize building a strong therapeutic relationship.

"Piggybacking on the other respondent's suggestions, I also agree that most couples could use more frequent and more bonding communication in their relationships, and this is a GREAT place to get the ball rolling towards reconnecting.Surveying the demographical data on long-term relationships, it's pretty common for couples to start to struggle around the 7-10 year mark and in fact, that's often when first time divorces happen. And for lots of reasons...most of them having something to do with beginning to take one another for granted and no longer doing the little things that nourish the relationship and light our partners up.  Seems like you've encountered this in your own relationship...where he appears to be neglecting your need for emotional connection with him.Doesn't have to be this way though. And from my own personal clinical experience, I can tell you that when even ONE partner is willing to make some small but powerful changes, they can often ripple outward to the other partner and bring about miraculous outcomes! So my encouragement to you is this - if you're still in love with him...even a little bit...and you're down to try something new, there's hope!  As hard as it may be, I would ask you to try and focus on YOUR own side of the street when approaching him. Use an open and curious approach with him. Ask him what he thinks he needs in a marriage. What is it about you he fell in love with? What helps him feel more fulfilled as a man and as a husband? What little things that you have done over the years does he appreciate? Like Sherry said, if you can get him talking, there'll be plenty to work with. We only need a spark to kindle a fire. If he can give you a list, you'll have a blueprint for getting him to reconnect with you and it opens the door for you to offer him little suggestions as well.By the time a couple reaches the point where you're at, there's usually very little fun going on. We've stopped enjoying one another's company. Try and think creatively about some shared experiences he might be willing to do. A picnic? Happy hour? Concerts, museums, cooking class, new sexual behaviors...the list is as infinite as you want it to be! Some of my favorite suggestions for couples looking to understand how they got here and how to build their way out are:""The Secret to Desire in a Long-Term Relationship"" (Ted Talk) by Esther Perel""Getting Together & Staying Together: Solving the Mystery of Marriage"" by William & Carleen Glasser""Divorce Busting - A Step By Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again"" by Michelle Weiner-Davis""The Relationship Cure: a 5 step Guide to Strengthening your Marriage, Family, and Friendships"" by John Gottman & Joan DeClaire""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by John Gottman & Nan Silver""The Five Love Languages"" by Gary ChapmanAnd of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't suggest that if you're open to the idea, maybe some individual and/ or couples counseling could be helpful too.My very warmest regards to you,Tamara Powell, LMHC </s>"," completely normal to feel disconnected from your partner after many years of being together. It's important to remember that relationships go through ups and downs, and it's okay if you're not feeling as close as you once did. Here are some things you can try to help you feel more reconnected with your husband:
1. Communicate openly and honestly: One of the most important things you can do is to talk to your husband openly and honestly about how you're feeling. Try to use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For example, you could say something like ""I've been feeling really disconnected from you lately, and I'm not sure why. Can we talk about what's going on and find a way to feel more connected?""
2. Make time for each other: With work and other obligations, it can be easy to let quality time with your partner fall by the wayside. Make a conscious effort to set aside time each day or week to spend together, whether it's a date night or just a quiet evening at home.
3. Rekindle shared interests: When you first started dating, you likely had a lot of shared interests and hobbies. Try to revisit some of those things together, or find new things to try together. This can help you feel more connected and like you're doing things together again.
4. Practice empathy and active listening: When you're feeling disconnected, it can be easy to start feeling like your partner is not listening to you or understanding how you're feeling. Practice active listening and empathy by really focusing on what your partner is saying and trying to understand their perspective.
5. Seek outside help: If you've tried talking to your husband and making time for each other, but you're still feeling disconnected, it may be helpful to seek outside help. Consider couples therapy, which can provide a safe and neutral space to work through your issues and find ways to feel more connected.

Remember, relationships take work and effort to maintain. It's okay if you're not feeling as close as you once did, but by communicating openly and honestly, making time for each other, revisiting shared interests, practicing empathy and active listening, and seeking outside help when needed, you can work towards feeling more reconnected.",1.4794824123382568,0.029199841650204162,,0.4018018018018018,0.05776173285198556,0.13513513513513514,0.8300338983535767,0.8123347163200378,0.8210889101028442,

"Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well! </s>","completely understandable to feel angry and lost when someone you care about is screaming at you all the time. It can be really difficult to deal with and can affect your mental health. 
Firstly, it's important to recognize that it's okay to feel angry and lost. It's normal to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when someone is treating you unfairly or disrespectfully. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and give yourself permission to feel them.
One thing you can try is to communicate with your girlfriend about how her behavior is affecting you. It's important to approach the conversation in a calm and respectful manner. Let her know how you feel and why you feel that way. It may be helpful to use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel upset and angry when you scream at me. It makes me feel disrespected and unheard.""
It's also important to listen to your girlfriend's perspective and try to understand where she is coming from. It may be that she is feeling stressed or overwhelmed and is not aware of the impact her behavior is having on you. By listening to each other and working together to find a solution, you may be able to find a way to improve the situation.
In addition to communicating with your girlfriend, it may be helpful to seek out professional counseling or therapy. A therapist can provide you with support and guidance on how to manage your emotions and deal with difficult situations. They can also help you develop healthy communication and conflict resolution skills.
Remember, it's okay to feel angry and lost, but it's important to take action to address the situation. By communicating with your girlfriend, seeking support from a therapist, and taking care of yourself, you can work towards finding a solution that works for everyone involved.

"I am so sorry this has happened to you! I hope you have some people you find emotionally supportive around you! In terms of your question, I understand what you are talking about. Sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event, an event called Dissociation occurs. Dissociation is the brain's way of temporary creating and increasing  ""emotional distance"" between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing. This is a kind of natural coping mechanism, and it can occur just prior to, during, and after an event has occurred. People describe the feeling as being ""numb,"" or detached from others, their surroundings, and even from their own body. All of these descriptions are accurate and they are your brain's attempt to try and keep you safe from emotions that may otherwise overwhelm you. This is good, in the short-term, because you are not having to immediately face and cope with the immensely painful feelings associated with your trauma. But it is also not-so-good in that it also blocks your ability to feel positive and pleasurable emotions. So while your brain is protecting you, it is also preventing feelings you need now more than ever (such as regaining a sense of safety, soothing your hurts, and feeling empowered for your survival).You are not a sociopath, so do not worry about that, but I would strongly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist or other supportive mental health professional to help you work through what is happened.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are also some things you can try on your own to help you feel more connected to your emotions. Here are a few suggestions:
1. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and emotional needs by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and connection. Talking to others who understand can be incredibly healing.
3. Engage in creative expression: Creative activities such as writing, art, or music can be a powerful way to express and process your emotions.

It's great to hear that your partner is willing to respect your beliefs on this matter. It's important to have open and honest communication in any relationship, and it's great that you're working together to find a solution that works for both of you.
If you're feeling uncomfortable or upset about the situation, it's important to communicate your feelings to your partner in a calm and respectful manner. It's possible that they didn't realize how their actions would affect you, and they may be willing to make amends or take steps to avoid similar situations in the future.
Remember that it's okay to set boundaries and expectations in any relationship, and it's important to communicate those boundaries clearly and respectfully. It's also important to be understanding and empathetic towards your partner's feelings and perspectives, and to work together to find a solution that works for both of you.
If you're feeling upset or uncomfortable about the situation, consider talking to a therapist or counselor for additional support and guidance. They can help you process your emotions and work through any challenges you're facing in your relationship.
Remember, communication and respect are key to any healthy and fulfilling relationship.

This can help you stay engaged and connected with the people you're interacting with, and it can also help you feel more comfortable and relaxed.

 It sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma.  It makes sense that you would feel nervous around people.  Working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process.  And then to add on the caretaker part can make things even more difficult.  First off, you may want to seek support to work through what you have experienced.  Many cities offer support with survivors of domestic violence and there is a hotline to help with this 888-724-7240 as well as online resources.  Processing the isolation of this relationship as well as working with your son can help to overcome the anxiety related to others.  Accessing autism support networks may be of support as well.  Other parents that will understand your experiences are a good and tend to be safer place to start in attempting to connect to others.Very importantly, go slow and be kind to yourself as you begin to adapt to a new life of allowing others to care for you as you so clearly have for others. </s>","completely understandable that you're feeling nervous around people after going through a traumatic experience like an abusive relationship. It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to help you feel more comfortable around others.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that healing takes time, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. It's not uncommon for people who have experienced trauma to feel anxious or uncomfortable around others, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety.
One way to start feeling more comfortable around others is to gradually expose yourself to small, manageable doses of social interaction. This could start with small, low-stakes interactions like chatting with a neighbor or coworker, or attending a support group for people who have experienced trauma. The goal is to gradually build up your comfort level and confidence in social situations.
It's also important to prioritize self-care and self-compassion during this process. This might involve engaging in activities that help you feel relaxed and grounded, such as yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature. It's also important to be kind to yourself and to recognize that healing is a process that takes time and patience.
Another helpful strategy is to seek out professional support from a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide a safe and supportive space to process your experiences and work through any challenges you're facing. They can also offer you tools and strategies to help you manage your anxiety and feel more comfortable around others.
Remember, healing from trauma is a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it.

"When we feel overwhelmed by life situations, it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from.  Once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.First, car accidents are common, and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us.   When we have an accident we feel anxious, worried, and may have some trauma after the accidents.  If you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident, talk to your doctor or therapist about it.  Second, a lot of people fail classes, tasks, deadlines, etc. but they don’t give up on their goal.  We have to remember that failing is part of the learning process, and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character.  Remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job, and the courage and determination that took to do so, then channel that energy back into school.  Third, when we have problems in our relationships, is helpful to look for ways to improve communication, discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them, but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isn’t enough interest in one of the parts or if there’s verbal or emotional abuse.  Consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communication.At all times:  focus on being kind to yourself and improving your self-esteem: increase self-care activities, do more things that you enjoy, meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life.   At the end, you are the one in control of your life, and you determine who you become.¿Qué puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de control?Estuve en un accidente de auto, y fue pérdida total.  Deje mi trabajo de 9 años para completar un grado a tiempo completo.  Falle una clase, y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida, el quiere dejarme.  No tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todo.Cuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones.  Ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio, es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron, y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vida.Primero, los accidentes de auto son comunes, y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas.  Cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos, preocupados, y puede que experimentemos algún trauma.  Si sientes ansiedad, extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto.  Segundo, muchas personas fallan clases, tareas, fechas de entrega, pero no se rinden.  Tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje, y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo, es lo que nos da determinación y carácter.   Recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela.  Tercero,  cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones, es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias, pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso.   Considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiada.En todo momento: enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima, aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien, medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades. </s>","tsk 😔 Sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time right now.

"Hi Texas,Oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it's a ""yes"", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. ""When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you're hiding something. I need openness"". If they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is ""They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious"". That's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. I can trust.""If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you. I hope that helps. </s>","completely normal to have some doubts and fears from time to time, especially when it comes to your safety and well-being. However, it's important to differentiate between legitimate concerns and mere paranoia. Here are some signs that your concerns might be more than just paranoia:
1. Persistence: If your fears or doubts persist even after you've gathered enough evidence to prove them wrong, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
2. Excessive worrying: If you find yourself constantly worrying about something, even when there's no real reason to do so, it could be a sign of paranoia.
3. Irrational fears: If your fears are irrational or unreasonable, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid. For example, if you're afraid of something that's highly unlikely to happen, it might be a sign of paranoia.
4. Lack of evidence: If you're basing your fears on a lack of evidence or on unreliable sources, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
5. Avoidance: If you're avoiding certain situations or activities because of your fears, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
6. Hypervigilance: If you're constantly on the lookout for potential threats or dangers, even when there's no real reason to do so, it could be a sign of paranoia.
7. Difficulty relaxing: If you find it hard to relax or feel at ease, even when you're in a safe and secure environment, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
8. Intrusive thoughts: If you find yourself constantly plagued by unwanted thoughts or ideas, it could be a sign of paranoia.
9. Social withdrawal: If you're withdrawing from social interactions or avoiding social situations because of your fears, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
10. Difficulty sleeping: If you're having trouble sleeping due to your fears or worries, it could be a sign that you're being paranoid.
If you find yourself exhibiting any of these signs, it's important to seek professional help from a mental health professional. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your fears and develop strategies to manage them in a healthy and productive way.
In the meantime, here are some things you can try to help manage your fears and worries:
1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your mind and body.
2. Challenge your thoughts: When you notice negative thoughts or fears, try to challenge them by asking yourself if they're really based on evidence or if they're just a product of your imagination.
3. Engage in activities you enjoy: Doing things you enjoy can help distract you from your fears and worries and improve your mood.
4. Seek support: Talking to friends, family, or a therapist can help you feel less alone and provide you with emotional support.
5. Keep a journal: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and gain perspective on your fears and worries.

"As a relationship therapist I work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood. How did you caregivers express (or not express) love towards you? How did they express (or not express) love towards one another. These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others. In his book Wired for Love, Stan Tatkin, PsyD writes “We learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone. We learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us. Our self worth and self-esteem also develop because of other people.”  This could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it, you may have to interview a few to find the right fit; that's OK.

2. Be direct and honest: Be clear and straightforward about what you saw and how it made you feel. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or accusing language.

Ask open-ended questions to help you better understand the situation. For example, ""How do you feel about this situation? Can you tell me more about your relationship with this person?""
5. Seek clarity: Ask your partner to clarify their relationship with the coworker. Be direct and clear about what you want to know. For example, ""Can you tell me if this person is a close friend or just a casual acquaintance?""
6. Be willing to forgive: If your partner is willing to be honest and open about their relationship with the coworker, be willing to forgive and move forward. It's important to remember that trust takes time to build, but with open communication and effort, it's possible to rebuild trust in a relationship.

"Developmentally, there are ages where not coloring in the lines, writing words that are jumbled together, and leaving big spaces or skipping lines are completely normal.  I have seen children in 3rd and in some cases, 4th grade who do not have learning disabilities write in the manner you have described.  There is, however, a type of learning disability called Dysgraphia which can present in the ways you have described. If you suspect that your daughter might have Dysgraphia, then the best thing to do is to have educational testing done.  You can request testing by going through your school system and asking for an IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) meeting.  Your school is required to honor your request for an IEP meeting.  At the meeting, you can ask the school to do educational testing that will be at no cost to you.  I will say that depending on where you live and your school system, it can sometimes be difficult to get the school system to do testing.  If that is the case, you can go to a psychologist or find an agency near you that can also perform this type of testing as well (some will accept insurance and others will not.)  There are also educational advocates that you can hire to help you if you ever have difficulty getting your daughter properly assessed by the school system.  I also highly recommend seeing a developmental ophthalmologist and/or a developmental pediatrician.  They can be great resources in helping you to determine if your daughter does have a learning disability.I always say that a parent should ""trust their gut"" and if you feel that your child is struggling and that there may be a learning disability then there is no harm in getting your child evaluated.  The best case scenario is that your child is completely on track and what you are seeing is developmentally appropriate.  On the other hand, if your child does have a learning disability, then you have caught it early enough where she can receive services that will help her in the long run. Either way, it is a win, win. </s>","completely normal for children in later elementary school to struggle with fine motor skills, including coloring inside the lines. It's important to remember that every child develops at their own pace, and some may need a little extra support and practice to master these skills.
Firstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect at coloring. It's important to have realistic expectations and to focus on the process of coloring rather than the end result. Encourage your daughter to enjoy the activity and to have fun with it, rather than feeling frustrated or discouraged if her colors don't stay inside the lines.
Next, let's explore some strategies that may help your daughter improve her coloring skills. One approach is to use larger spaces or skip lines altogether, as you mentioned. This can help her focus on the coloring process without getting frustrated by the lines. You can also try using different colors or crayons to help her gain more control over the movement of her hand.
Another strategy is to practice coloring in different contexts, such as coloring books, coloring pages online, or even just coloring with her favorite toys. The more she practices, the more comfortable she will become with the activity. You can also try incorporating coloring into other activities, such as during a car ride or while watching a movie.
It's also important to be patient and supportive. Encourage your daughter to take her time and to not get frustrated if she makes mistakes. Praise her for her efforts and encourage her to keep trying. Remind her that it's okay to make mistakes and that they are an important part of the learning process.
Finally, if you notice that your daughter's struggles with coloring are impacting her enjoyment of the activity or causing her significant distress, you may want to consider consulting with a pediatric occupational therapist. They can assess her fine motor skills and provide targeted strategies and activities to help her improve her coloring skills.
In conclusion, coloring inside the lines can be a challenging task for some children, but with patience, practice, and support, they can improve their skills and enjoy the activity.

1. Mental health issues: Some mental health conditions, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or depression, can cause individuals to act out in inappropriate ways. This can include inappropriate toileting habits.
2. Dementia or cognitive impairment: If your family members are experiencing cognitive decline or dementia, they may not be able to control their bladder or bowel movements. This can lead to inappropriate toileting habits.
3. Incontinence: Urinary incontinence is a common problem in older adults, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including weakened bladder muscles, nerve damage, or medical conditions such as a urinary tract infection. If your family members are experiencing incontinence, they may not be able to hold their urine properly.
4. Substance abuse: In some cases, individuals may engage in inappropriate toileting habits as a result of substance abuse or dependence. This can include using drugs or alcohol to cope with stress or other emotional issues.

 Ugh!  We spend so many hours at work, so if it's a tough environment it can really drag you down.  Is this your ""dream job"" gone sour or a ""just pay the bills"" deal that has gotten stale?  It makes a big difference in terms of next steps.For example, if this job is a step on the way to a bigger goal, it might be time to assess whether you need to be moving along to then next phase.  Have you learned what you needed to learn to make this a helpful experience?  Or do you sense there is more to learn, but you feel stuck in some way? If this current job is part of a bigger plan, then you need to practice some good self care, set up ways to remind yourself why you are doing what you are doing, and make sure you are including some ""carrots"" along the way.  That might mean spending some time each week networking (preferably live but online works well too) with peers in similar situations (entrepreneur groups, skill building trainings, etc).  Big dreams require small steps, but we all need support along the way.If , however, this is ""just a job"", then you really have to reassess your situation.  If you are burned out and not getting paid your worth then  look around for other opportunities.  You are employed, not owned.  You mentioned anxiety, and while I don't want to minimize the very real issues anxiety presents, is it possible that some of your anxiety can be seen as ""revving your engine""  and readying you to move on?  Or is it that pervasive feeling  of never being able to finish your work, feeling like you will be ""in trouble"", or dreading every single moment of your workday?  The first is a potentially positive motivator, the second is just bad for you.   See the difference?In order to feel any satisfaction with your job, it needs to be financially rewarding (to a level that makes sense), be a good atmosphere to learn, be supportive and/or be a step on the way to a bigger plan you have.  If your job isn't fulfilling any of those criteria, you need to move on.  And finally, if the only reason you have this job is to pay the bills, and you truly see no way around keeping your current position for now, remember why you are there - this is a job, not a family.  You rent your brain and body to your employer, not your heart and soul.  Those belong to you and you are responsible for feeding them.  That means good self-care, making sure you have social engagement (face-to-face, not just online), move your body, feel the sun on your face daily, creating ways to refresh your body and mind and generally taking care of your whole being.Discomfort exists for a reason - it primes us for change, gives us the necessary motivation to take reasonable risks, and pesters us until we do so.  The first step is to figure out what change is realistic, and take action. </s>","completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and demoralized in a high-stress position, especially when you're not feeling valued or fairly compensated for your work. Here are some strategies that may help you manage your stress and maintain your well-being:
1. Practice self-care: Make sure you're taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. This can include exercise, meditation, getting enough sleep, and taking breaks throughout the day to do something you enjoy.
2. Set boundaries: Learn to say no to tasks that are beyond your capacity or that you know will add to your stress levels. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.
3. Communicate with your team and manager: Have an open and honest conversation with your team and manager about your workload and how you're feeling. They may be able to help you prioritize tasks or provide additional support.
4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your stress and how it's impacting you. They can offer emotional support and help you develop coping strategies.
5. Consider seeking a change: If you've tried the above strategies and still feel like you're in a toxic work environment, it may be time to consider looking for a new job. It's important to prioritize your well-being and find a workplace that values and supports you.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Seeking support from colleagues, friends, and mental health professionals can be incredibly helpful in managing stress and maintaining your well-being. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it.

I would encourage you to use your gut in this situation because you know your relationship better then anyone else.  The best thing for you to do is to keep yourself emotionally and physically safe. I would encourage against couples counseling because it can also become unsafe in an abusive relationship. You are making a big step in looking for help. </s>","completely understandable that you're feeling upset and concerned about the way your partner is treating you. Verbal abuse, including name-calling and vulgar language, is never okay in any relationship. It's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated with disrespect or cruelty, and it's not your fault if your partner is behaving this way.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that verbal abuse is a form of emotional abuse, and it can have serious negative effects on a person's mental and emotional well-being. It can make a person feel belittled, humiliated, and worthless. It's important to recognize the signs of verbal abuse and seek help if you're in a toxic relationship.
If you feel like you're in danger or unsafe in your relationship, please reach out to a domestic violence hotline or a crisis center for help. They can provide you with emotional support, resources, and a safe place to stay.
If you're not in immediate danger but are still experiencing verbal abuse, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your well-being. Here are some suggestions:
1. Set boundaries: It's important to communicate your boundaries clearly and assertively. Let your partner know that you will not tolerate verbal abuse and that you expect to be treated with respect.
2. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by doing things that make you feel good, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends.
3. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about what you're going through. They can offer emotional support and help you develop a plan to stay safe.
4. Consider couples therapy: If you're interested in working through your issues with your partner, consider couples therapy. A therapist can help you and your partner communicate more effectively and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to the verbal abuse.
Remember, you don't deserve to be treated with disrespect or cruelty in any relationship. You have the right to be treated with love, respect, and kindness.

 Therapy is essential for those that are feeling depressed and worthless. When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem.

CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave.

In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help shift your focus and change your perspective:
1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding with yourself, just as you would with a close friend. Remind yourself that everyone has struggles and that it is okay to not be perfect.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you notice negative thoughts, try to reframe them in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking ""I'm worthless,"" try thinking ""I'm struggling, but I'm doing the best I can.""
3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your weaknesses, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.
4. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and encouragement. Talking to others who understand can be a great way to gain perspective and feel less alone.
5. Take care of yourself: Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Taking care of your physical and emotional needs can help improve your overall well-being.
Remember, it is okay to struggle and it is important to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through these feelings. With time and effort, you can learn to manage your negative thoughts and develop a more positive outlook.

 First off, there is nothing wrong with you.  In fact, having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal.  Sometimes our thoughts think they are protecting us (if we think we aren't worth anything, it won't hurt when we get rejected) but they are actually doing quite the opposite.  They are keeping us ""stuck"" and creating a self-prophization.  (If I think I am not worth anything, I don't have to try, and I will keep proving to myself that I am not worth anything).  There are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative self-talk.  There are actually many self-help workbooks that can help with this as well.  A technique I like to use is meditation or mindfulness.  This can teach us to accept our thoughts (not fight them) and then learn to let them go.  Release the power they have on us.  If we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them, this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in.  Mantras can help with this as well (I AM worth a lot, I AM important, I have value).  Saying these to yourself everyday over and over (even if at first you don't believe) can retrain our brains to believe it (and allow us to believe it).  I have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so I am forced to look at these throughout the day.Please remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns.  It took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal.  So allow the process to happen slowly and allow yourself to accept you as the amazing and brave person you are. </s>","completely normal to have random thoughts that may not be entirely positive or constructive, especially when we're feeling stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed. It's important to recognize that these thoughts are not a reflection of your worth or identity, and they don't define who you are as a person.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel overwhelmed or upset when you're experiencing these thoughts. It's important to recognize that you're not alone in this experience, and many people struggle with similar thoughts and feelings.
One way to manage these thoughts is to challenge them when they arise. When you notice these negative thoughts, try to reframe them in a more positive or realistic way.

Another strategy is to practice self-compassion and self-care. This can involve engaging in activities that help you relax and reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. It's also important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, and to take time for yourself when you need it.
It can also be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a great way to gain perspective and support.

It's important to recognize that these feelings are valid and not necessarily a problem.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel upset or frustrated when something small goes wrong, and it's important to give yourself permission to feel these emotions. It's also important to recognize that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth or identity.

"Deciding to end a relationship is never easy, especially if there is not any strong reason or incident standing out to help define the unhappiness in the relationship, such as infidelity or abuse.  All relationships go through low periods where one or both people may feel unhappy in the relationship, this is normal.  What I tell my clients when they are facing this decision is to spend some time and imagine your life without the person in it.  What do you feel when you imagine your life without your boyfriend?  Do you see yourself as being happier, having more freedom?  When you think of life without him do you feel a weight lift off your shoulders?  Is it easier to breathe?  Don't rush into any decision about leaving the relationship.  Take as much time as you need to fully understand what it is you are feeling right now.  Ask yourself if some of the unhappiness in the relationship can change, if it is likely to change.  Only when you are confident in your decision to leave should you then have the discussion about leaving the relationship.  I hope this answer gives you some ways of thinking through how to make that very tough decision. </s>","completely normal to feel uncertain or unsure about whether to end a relationship, especially if it's been a significant part of your life for a while. Here are some things you might want to consider when deciding whether to end your relationship:
1. Communication and connection: Are you and your boyfriend able to communicate effectively and connect on a deep level? If you find yourself feeling disconnected or unheard, it may be a sign that the relationship is no longer working for you.
2. Trust and respect: Do you trust your boyfriend and respect him as a person? If you find yourself constantly questioning his actions or doubting his intentions, it may be a sign that the relationship is no longer healthy.
3. Growth and fulfillment: Are you growing and feeling fulfilled in the relationship? If you find yourself feeling stagnant or unchallenged, it may be a sign that it's time to move on.
4. Personal values and goals: Are your personal values and goals aligned with those of your boyfriend? If you find yourself feeling like you're compromising too much or feeling like you're not living up to your own potential, it may be a sign that it's time to end the relationship.
5. Support and encouragement: Does your boyfriend support and encourage you in your goals and aspirations? If you find yourself feeling unsupported or unencouraged, it may be a sign that the relationship is no longer serving you.

It's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to whether you should end a relationship. Take the time to reflect on your feelings and what's important to you, and don't be afraid to reach out for support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need it.

"Thanks for the question. Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with ""I"" as opposed to ""you."" For example, you can tell him, ""I feel angry when you raise your voice at me"" instead of ""You always yell at me."" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect of:""Dad, I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively.

It's possible that your father is not aware of the impact his tone is having on you, and it may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about how his behavior is making you feel. It's important to approach this conversation in a calm and non-confrontational manner, and to try to use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and concerns.
For example, you could say something like: ""Dad, I want to talk to you about the way you've been speaking to me lately. It feels really hurtful and disrespectful, and it's making me feel upset and uncomfortable. I understand that you're stressed about work and your health, but I don't think it's okay to take it out on me like this. Can we find a way to communicate that doesn't involve yelling or being demanding?""
It's also important to be clear and specific about how you want to be treated and to set boundaries around what is and is not acceptable. You have the right to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to stand up for yourself and advocate for your own feelings and needs.
Remember that it may take some time and effort to change your father's behavior, and it's important to be patient and understanding. It's also important to take care of yourself and to seek support from other people in your life if you need it.

Being verbally abused by your parents in front of your child can have a significant impact on your mental health and well-being. It is important to remember that you do not have to tolerate this behavior and that there are resources available to help you cope with this difficult situation.
Firstly, it is important to recognize that you are not alone in this situation. Many people experience verbal abuse from their parents, and there are organizations and support groups that can provide you with emotional support and guidance. Reaching out to these organizations can help you connect with others who understand what you are going through and can offer you practical advice and emotional support.
One way to cope with verbal abuse is to practice self-care. This can involve taking time for yourself each day to engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This can include exercise, meditation, reading, or spending time with friends and loved ones. By taking care of yourself, you can reduce your stress levels and improve your overall well-being.
Another way to cope with verbal abuse is to set boundaries with your parents. This can involve calmly and assertively telling them how their behavior is affecting you and asking them to stop. It is important to be clear and direct when setting boundaries, and to be prepared for the possibility that they may not immediately comply. However, by setting boundaries, you can help to protect yourself from further emotional harm.
If you are feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope with the verbal abuse, it may be helpful to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide you with emotional support and guidance on how to manage your emotions and cope with the situation. They can also help you to develop a plan for how to handle the verbal abuse and to find ways to protect yourself and your child from further harm.

Remember to be kind to yourself and to prioritize your own well-being. It's okay to feel sad and hurt, but try not to dwell on negative feelings for too long. Focus on taking care of yourself and on moving forward in a positive direction.
It's also important to remember that you have the power to create the life you want. It may take time and effort, but you can work towards building a fulfilling and happy life for yourself. Whether that means pursuing new hobbies and interests, spending time with loved ones, or focusing on your career, remember that you have the power to create the life you want.

But lately I've been overreacting a lot when she's just doing normal things. I think it's triggering my bad past relationships.
 What's most important is that you recognize that what you've been doing is off base - that what you've been feeling is ""overreacting,"" that you have ""insecurities,"" and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner. That's an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself, it's unlikely that you would change.That said, you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth... not because there is something ""wrong"" with you, but because you're ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior.

It's important to recognize that these feelings are not a reflection of your partner's character, but rather a manifestation of your own emotional baggage. Here are some suggestions that may help you overcome these insecurities and trust your partner more:
1. Identify and acknowledge your triggers: Take some time to reflect on your past relationships and identify the specific behaviors or situations that triggered your insecurity. Once you're aware of what triggers you, you can work on developing coping strategies to deal with those triggers in a healthier way.
2. Communicate with your partner: It's essential to communicate your feelings and concerns with your partner. Be honest and open about how their actions or behaviors make you feel, and ask them to be patient and understanding. By communicating openly and honestly, you can work together to find ways to address your insecurities.
3. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by engaging in activities that help you relax and reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends. When you feel more grounded and centered, you'll be less likely to overreact to your partner's normal behaviors.
4. Focus on the present: Rather than dwelling on past experiences or worrying about the future, try to stay present in the moment. Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or focusing on your senses, to help you stay grounded in the present.
5. Work on building trust: Trust is built through consistent behavior and actions, so make an effort to be reliable and follow through on your commitments. Be transparent and honest in your interactions with your partner, and work on establishing a strong foundation of trust.
6. Seek professional help: If your insecurities and trust issues are impacting your relationship significantly, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide you with the tools and support you need to work through these issues and improve your relationship.

Remember, overcoming insecurities and building trust takes time and effort from both partners.

"Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated, as you have noticed, and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications. While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication, as you have pointed out, there are often negative side effects as well. While I can't give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and long-term costs and benefits of psychiatric medication.

It's great that you've recognized the importance of addressing the underlying issues that were contributing to your depression, and it's important to give yourself time and space to work on those.

It's important to note that Wellbutrin is a medication that can take several weeks to start working, and it may take even longer to notice the full effects. It's possible that the improvements you noticed after the first week were due to the medication's cumulative effects, rather than just the immediate effects of the first dose.


It's also important to keep in mind that antidepressants like Wellbutrin can have withdrawal effects, especially if you stop taking them abruptly. These effects can include feelings of anxiety, irritability, and depression, and they can last for several days or even weeks. It's possible that you may be experiencing some of these withdrawal effects, which could be contributing to your feelings of zombie-like haze and lack of interest in activities.

Although everyone may not agree with one another, the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction. There are many families that are united despite their differences.

Counselor: Oh, I see. It's completely understandable to feel anxious about a funeral, especially when there are different customs and traditions involved. It can be challenging to navigate these situations, but there are a few things you can do to make it easier.
Firstly, it's important to communicate with your family members ahead of time and express your concerns. Let them know how you're feeling and ask them to be understanding and respectful of each other's beliefs and practices. It may also be helpful to provide some guidelines or suggestions for how you would like the funeral to be conducted.
Additionally, you may want to consider involving a neutral third party, such as a funeral director or religious leader, who can help facilitate the funeral and ensure that everyone's needs are met. They can also provide guidance on how to navigate any cultural or religious differences that may arise.
It's also important to remember that it's okay to have different customs and traditions, and that it's important to respect and honor the beliefs and practices of all family members.

 Teenage years are rough for anyone, and this is a time for self-discovery and experimentation. Having older parents can certainly pose challenges. Most kids feel like their parents don't understand them, but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers. They're from a completely different generation than you are. It sounds like they love you, but may not understand you. The problem here is the generation/age gap, and there's not a whole lot you can do about that. What you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently. It seems like you're looking for affirmation from them, looking for their approval and understanding. It's never a good idea to look to others to define who you are or to get a self-esteem boost. Who you are and how you feel about yourself needs to come from inside, not from outside. One way you can have a better relationship with your parents is to stop looking at all the things you aren't getting from them that you want, and rather look at all the things you are getting from them.

This doesn't have to mean hitting the gym or running a marathon, but rather finding ways to stay engaged in activities that you enjoy, whether that's going for a walk, practicing yoga, or playing a sport. Exercise can help release endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.
2. Get enough sleep: Sleep is essential for overall mental health, and can be especially important during the winter months when it's easier to stay in bed. Make sure you're getting enough rest, and try to establish a consistent sleep schedule to help regulate your body's internal clock.
3. Connect with others: Social support is crucial for managing SAD. Reach out to friends and family, or join a support group to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
4. Try light therapy: Light therapy involves exposure to bright, artificial light that mimics natural sunlight. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve your mood. There are a variety of light therapy products available, including lamps, boxes, and even special glasses.
5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is a technique that involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. This can help you focus on the things that are going well in your life, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts about the weather. Try incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine through activities like meditation or deep breathing exercises.

"Hi Biddeford,This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens. Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter ""do this now"", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say ""let's get you dressed"", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says ""no"". You can say ""ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later."" The choice is hers. Then follow through.""When...then"" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try ""as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack"". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it. Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck! </s>","completely normal for toddlers to test boundaries and push limits, especially when it comes to authority figures like parents. It's important to remember that your child is still learning how to navigate social interactions and understand the world around them. Here are some strategies that may help you work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time:
1. Practice active listening: When your child says ""no"" to something, try actively listening to their reasons. Ask open-ended questions like ""Why do you not want to do that?"" or ""What do you want to do instead?"" This can help you understand their perspective and validate their feelings.
2. Use positive language: Instead of using phrases like ""I'm the boss and I say you have to do this,"" try using positive language that emphasizes mutual respect. For example, you could say ""I appreciate your input, let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.""
3. Offer choices: Giving your child choices can help them feel more in control and valued. For example, you could say ""Do you want to wear the blue shirt or the green shirt today?"" This can help them feel more invested in the decision-making process.
4. Set clear boundaries: While it's important to avoid being too controlling, it's also important to set clear boundaries and expectations for your child's safety and well-being. Make sure to communicate these boundaries in a calm and respectful manner.
5. Practice patience and empathy: It's important to remember that your child is still learning and developing their social skills. Try to approach situations with patience and empathy, rather than getting frustrated or angry. This can help your child feel more secure and valued in the relationship.
6. Encourage self-expression: Allow your child to express themselves through play and exploration. This can help them develop their own identity and sense of self, which can lead to more assertive behavior.
7. Offer opportunities for decision-making: Give your child opportunities to make decisions and choices, such as choosing what to eat for dinner or what activity to do together. This can help them feel more invested in the decision-making process and more in control of their life.
8. Teach problem-solving skills: Help your child develop problem-solving skills by encouraging them to think creatively and come up with solutions to challenges they face. This can help them feel more confident and in control of their own life.
9. Practice role-playing: Role-playing can be a fun and effective way to teach your child how to communicate and assert themselves in different situations. Practice scenarios like standing up for themselves, saying no to peers, or expressing their needs and wants.
10. Seek support: Raising a child can be challenging, so don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, or a professional counselor. Talking through your concerns and strategies with someone who understands can be incredibly helpful in managing the emotional demands of parenting.
Remember, it's important to be patient and understanding as your child develops their assertiveness and independence.

It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are resources available to help you cope with the verbal abuse you are experiencing.
Firstly, it's important to recognize that you are not alone in this situation. Many people experience verbal abuse from their parents, and it's not your fault. It's important to remember that you don't deserve to be treated this way, and you don't have to accept it as a normal part of your life.
One way to cope with the verbal abuse is to seek support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist. Talking to someone who is not directly involved in the abuse can help you process your feelings and gain a different perspective on the situation. They can also provide emotional support and help you develop coping strategies.
Another option is to seek out support groups for people who have experienced verbal abuse. These groups can provide a safe and supportive environment where you can connect with others who understand what you are going through. You can share your experiences, receive emotional support, and learn coping strategies from others who have gone through similar situations.
In addition to seeking support from others, it's important to take care of yourself. This can include engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. These activities can help reduce stress and anxiety, and improve your overall well-being.
Finally, it's important to remember that you have the right to set boundaries and protect yourself from further abuse. This may involve having difficult conversations with your parents, or seeking outside help such as a mediator or a social worker. Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's okay to stand up for yourself and set boundaries to protect your own well-being.

"Guilt is a narcissistic, self-indulgent focus on me, me, me; it's best not to keep it in negative light;What does that mean?  Well, it stems from mankind having an animal nature, and a spiritual nature;In most societies today, the animal nature is looked down upon, seen as egregious and something to be put away;If I may say to you, it is necessary and important (if you wish to end an experience called ""guilt"") to NOT regard your animal nature as negative, but to accept that you have it, and acknowledge it;The more openly a man or woman acknowledges they're animal-side, the quicker one may subdue it;Try giving your animal nature a name, and talk to it like a cute pet... ""Oh, hey, there, Snorky!  Oh, what's that?  You want to be a wealthy, famous Hollywood idol?  Oh, really!  Agaiiiiiiin, Snorky!  Geez, you're impossible!  Ain't you just the cutest thing!"" </s>"," completely understandable that you are feeling guilty after a night of drinking, especially if you have a history of acting out while under the influence. It's important to recognize that your feelings of guilt are not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign that you are taking responsibility for your actions and are motivated to make positive changes in your life.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that alcohol can have a significant impact on our behavior and decision-making processes. When we are under the influence, our inhibitions are lowered, and we may engage in behaviors that we would not normally do when sober. This can include acting out in ways that are harmful to ourselves or others, such as cheating on a partner.
It's important to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle. Many people have found themselves in similar situations, and it's okay to ask for help. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. They can provide a listening ear and help you work through your feelings of guilt and shame.
In addition to seeking support from others, there are also some things you can do on your own to help manage your feelings of guilt. One important step is to practice self-compassion and self-forgiveness. This can involve treating yourself with kindness and understanding, rather than beating yourself up over your mistakes. Remember that you are human, and it's okay to make mistakes.
Another helpful strategy is to focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on past mistakes. When you are feeling guilty, it can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts and emotions, but try to instead focus on what you can do in the present to make things right. For example, if you cheated on your partner, try to communicate with them in a respectful and empathetic way to make amends.
Finally, it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. This can involve engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. By taking care of yourself, you can help reduce feelings of guilt and improve your overall mental health.
In conclusion, it's completely understandable that you are feeling guilty after a night of drinking, and it's important to recognize that this is a common experience for many people.

It's important to remember that healing takes time, and it's okay to take things at your own pace.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you've been through a lot and that it's okay to feel scared or nervous around people. It's normal to feel this way after experiencing abuse, and it doesn't mean that you're weak or flawed in any way.
One thing you can try is to start small. Begin by exposing yourself to small, manageable social situations. For example, you could try going to a local park or coffee shop and spending time with a small group of people you feel comfortable with. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually increase the size of the social situations you participate in.
It can also be helpful to practice mindfulness and self-care techniques. Mindfulness involves being present and aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. You can try practicing mindfulness through meditation, deep breathing, or simply paying attention to your senses. Self-care involves taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. You can try engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as reading, taking a bath, or listening to music.

A mental health professional can provide you with a safe and supportive environment to process your feelings and work through your experiences. They can also offer you tools and strategies to manage your anxiety and feel more comfortable around people.

"Hello. You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection. Without knowing more about the ""complicated"" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him?  Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on ""what if"" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure. However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Other times, it is Making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones. Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca </s>","completely understandable that you're feeling afraid and unsure about how to keep your relationship going while your partner is away serving in the military. It's a challenging and unfamiliar situation for both of you, and it's natural to feel anxious or scared about the future.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel scared or unsure about how to navigate this situation. It's okay to feel like you're losing control or feeling uncertain about the future. Allow yourself to feel these emotions, and try not to suppress them. Instead, try to talk to your partner about how you're feeling and see if they can offer any support or reassurance.
One way to keep your relationship going while your partner is away is to maintain open and regular communication with each other. Make an effort to call or video call each other regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. This can help you feel more connected and can also help you stay updated on each other's lives.
Another way to keep your relationship strong is to make plans together for when your partner returns. This could be something as simple as a special dinner or a weekend getaway. Having something to look forward to can help you feel more positive and hopeful about the future.
It's also important to remember that this is a temporary situation, and that your partner will eventually return. Try to focus on the present moment and the time you do have together, rather than worrying too much about the future.
Finally, don't be afraid to reach out for support from friends, family, or a therapist if you need it. It can be helpful to talk to someone who can offer a neutral perspective and provide emotional support.

"Hi Troy, I totally get this. It's a dilemma; you want your dad to know how he's hurting you but you don't feel safe enough to say anything to him. Your reaction is understandable; it's his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open. But that's not who your dad is. Your dad is your dad, and waiting for him to change won't really help. Nothing you do can change your dad, but...there are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him. While your response of avoiding him is understandable, I wonder what effect it has on your dad.

His frustration comes out as more rudeness, which makes you want to withdraw more, and the cycle starts all over again.

Lastly, try to be patient with yourself. Healing takes time, and it's okay if you don't feel better right away. It's like you're going through a storm, and the clouds will eventually pass. Just hang in there, and know that things will get better with time.
Remember, you are strong and capable, and you will get through this. *Sympathetic smile*",1.6309679746627808,0.012785727941944556,,0.40298507462686567,0.04790419161676647,0.13134328358208955,0.834276020526886,0.8252251744270325,0.8297259211540222,
"Hi Bend, You're scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like ""No one will ever love me again?"", or ""I'm going to get hurt again"", or ""I can't trust myself""? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually, with time. :) </s>"," Hello there! *empathetic nod* Sorry to hear that you're having trouble moving on from your ex.

"Probably.  I always tell the new parents I work with (and this is just as true for dads as it is for moms) that if you are feeling off, seek help.  Postpartum Support International (www.postpartum.net) is a great place to start finding resources and locating support. </s>"," completely understandable to feel down and out after having a baby, especially after the initial excitement and euphoria of the first few weeks have worn off.

However, I can offer some general information and support to help you better understand your feelings and what you can do to manage them.
Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that it is normal to feel emotional and overwhelmed after having a baby. The transition to motherhood can be significant, and it is common to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion. These feelings are usually temporary and can be managed with time and support.
If you are concerned that you might be experiencing PPD, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can assess your symptoms and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, here are some common symptoms of PPD:
* Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and helplessness
* Loss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy
* Changes in appetite or sleep patterns
* Difficulty bonding with your baby
* Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
* Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or shame
* Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby

It is important to remember that PPD is a treatable condition, and seeking help is the first step towards recovery. Your healthcare provider may recommend therapy, medication, or a combination of both to help manage your symptoms. In addition, there are many self-care strategies that can help you cope with PPD, such as:
* Practicing self-care and self-compassion
* Connecting with other new mothers through support groups or online communities
* Finding ways to relax and manage stress, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises
* Setting realistic expectations and boundaries, and prioritizing your own needs and well-being

1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your mind and body. You can find guided relaxation exercises online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.

3. Challenge negative thoughts: When you start to feel anxious, pay attention to your thoughts and try to challenge any negative or catastrophic thinking. Ask yourself if there's evidence to support your worries, and try to replace them with more realistic and positive thoughts.
4. Use positive self-talk: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations, such as ""I can handle this,"" ""I'm strong and capable,"" or ""I'll get through this with ease.""
5. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your anxiety. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel more connected and less alone. You can also join a support group or online community to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

"Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define ""infidelity"". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, ""I feel you distancing from me."" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs. The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a ""sweetheart."" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean ""you're so sweet and kind"", ""my dear"", or in a flirtatious manner to mean ""sweetie."" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said.  If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, ""I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much."" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""I'm sorry."" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""I'm sorry"", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating. For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469. </s>","completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and helpless in this situation.

In terms of changing your feelings of worthlessness, it can be helpful to focus on building your self-esteem and self-worth. This can involve identifying your strengths and positive qualities, and focusing on these rather than your weaknesses or negative thoughts. It can also be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, and work towards these in a gradual and consistent manner.
Additionally, it can be helpful to challenge negative self-talk and replace it with more positive and realistic thoughts. For example, instead of thinking ""I'm worthless and no one cares about me,"" try reframing this thought to ""I'm struggling right now, but I'm not worthless and there are people in my life who care about me.""
Remember, it takes time and effort to work through these feelings and to build a more positive and healthy sense of self-worth. Be patient with yourself and remember that you are not alone in this struggle.

2. Consider a different bra size: If you're wearing a bra that's too big, it may be time to get a bra that fits better. You can talk to a salesperson at a department store or specialty bra shop to find a bra that's the right size for you.
3. Find ways to feel comfortable: If you're uncomfortable inviting your friends over or hanging out at your house, try to find other ways to spend time with them. You could suggest going to a movie, going for a walk, or doing something else that makes you feel more comfortable.
4. Practice self-care: It's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own feelings and needs. Make sure to take time for yourself each day, whether that's reading a book, taking a bath, or doing something else that makes you feel good.

"<s> <<SYS>> Respond accordingly to the provided context. Try to give adequate counseling to the user. Show empathetic responses and naturality when answering. <</SYS>> [INST] How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 The first thing I would ask yourself is how do you feel when it is time to go to therapy? What do you notice inside your body? Are you sick to your stomach? Neutral? Dreading it? Your body will give you indications as to how safe you feel. Your relationship with your therapist is like any other relationship...you need to feel safe, accepted and understood. You want to see someone who you look forward to sitting across from and feel comfortable talking about whatever is on your heart and mind.  What are you preferences? Do you feel more comfortable with a male or female therapist? Does their age matter? What kind of therapy do you want to do? Do you know? If not, you might want to talk to friends or family who have done therapy and ask them what they liked or didn't like, what worked for them and what the process was like. You can always talk to a prospective therapist about all the questions you have (Have they worked with others with your issues? Have they ever been in therapy? Where did they go to school? What kind of training do they have? Etc.) You may not know in the first session or two if you have the right therapist but pay attention to how you feel while you are there. Your therapist should check in with you and ask how you are feeling. If it's not a good match for you, your therapist should try and help you find someone who will be a good match. Your trust and connection with your therapist is the biggest indicator for success in therapy. Both of you should be concerned about your alliance and any good therapist will want you to find the best therapist for you! </s>","thetic voice}: Hello there! I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you may have about therapy. It's completely normal to feel unsure or uncertain about finding the right therapist for you, but don't worry, I'm here to offer some helpful advice.
Firstly, it's important to remember that finding the right therapist is a personal and subjective process. What works for one person may not work for another, so it's essential to find someone who fits your unique needs and preferences. Here are some factors to consider when searching for the right therapist:
1. Credentials and Experience: Make sure the therapist you're considering has the necessary education, training, and experience in the areas you're seeking help with.
2. Personal Chemistry: It's crucial to find a therapist with whom you feel comfortable and have a good rapport. Consider their communication style, personality, and approach to therapy.
3. Specialization: If you have a specific issue or concern, look for a therapist who specializes in that area. For example, if you're struggling with anxiety, find a therapist who has experience in anxiety disorders.
4. Availability and Location: Ensure the therapist has availability at times that work for you, and their location is convenient for you to access.
5. Cost and Insurance: Consider the cost of therapy and whether your insurance covers the therapist's services.

Now, regarding ""training"" your therapist, it's important to remember that therapists are trained professionals who are skilled in providing evidence-based therapy techniques. However, you can communicate your needs and preferences to your therapist and work together to develop a personalized treatment plan that meets your unique needs. Here are some ways to communicate with your therapist and ""train"" them to give you what you need from treatment:
1. Be Open and Honest: Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with your therapist. Be open and honest about what you want to achieve from therapy and what you're hoping to get out of it.
2. Set Goals and Expectations: Work with your therapist to set clear goals and expectations for your therapy sessions. This can help you stay motivated and focused throughout the treatment process.
3. Be Active and Engaged: Take an active role in your therapy sessions by asking questions, sharing your thoughts, and actively participating in the therapeutic process.
4. Provide Feedback: Offer feedback to your therapist about their approach and techniques. Let them know what's working for you and what's not, and work together to find a approach that's effective for you.
5. Be Patient and Persistent: Remember that therapy is a process that takes time and effort. Be patient and persistent in your efforts, and don't give up if you don't see immediate results.

I hope these tips are helpful in your search for the right therapist and in your therapy sessions. Remember, finding the right therapist and developing a successful therapeutic relationship takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end.

"Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. It does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. Ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. Personally, I am big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman's book on Amazon for under $9. It's a good deal. There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. http://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships/effective-communication.htm You can try them and see if they are helpful. ***It is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. I hope these suggestions help, and good luck.Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC </s>","great that you're taking proactive steps to address the issues in your relationship and work towards making things right. Listening and self-reflection are crucial skills to develop in any relationship, and it's great that you're looking to improve these areas. Here are some suggestions on how you can learn to listen and get yourself together:
1. Practice active listening: Active listening is a technique where you fully concentrate on what your partner is saying, without interrupting or judging. Give your full attention to them, and try to understand their perspective. You can practice active listening by repeating back what you heard your partner say, or by asking open-ended questions to encourage them to share more.
2. Take responsibility for your actions: It's important to take responsibility for your actions and their impact on your relationship. Acknowledge any mistakes you've made and make amends if possible. This can help to rebuild trust and improve communication in your relationship.
3. Identify your emotional triggers: We all have emotional triggers that can cause us to react in certain ways. Identify any triggers that may be contributing to the problems in your relationship, and work on managing those triggers. This can help you to respond in a more thoughtful and constructive way.
4. Practice empathy: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. Practice putting yourself in your partner's shoes and trying to understand their feelings. This can help you to be more understanding and supportive.
5. Seek outside help: If you're struggling to improve your communication and relationship skills on your own, consider seeking outside help. A couples therapist or counselor can provide you with the tools and support you need to work through your issues.
Remember, improving a relationship takes time, effort, and commitment from both parties. It's important to be patient, empathetic, and willing to work together to overcome any challenges you're facing. With time and effort, you can learn to listen and get yourself together, and build a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.
